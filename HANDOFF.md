# Handoff

Complete orientation for OPVSCVLA. Paste this plus the files in scope at the
start of a session — it's meant to be enough to work without re-explaining.

---

## Architecture

**OPVSCVLA is twenty-two independent single-file Web Audio machines** plus a static
landing page. There is **no build step, no bundler, no dependencies, no npm, no
samples, no server-side anything.** Each `op.` is one self-contained
`index.html` — inline `<style>`, inline `<script>`, all synthesis in the
Web Audio API. GitHub Pages serves the repo as-is.

The machines share a design *grammar* (see Conventions) but **not code** — each
is deliberately standalone so it can be opened, copied, or shared as a single
file. Do not try to factor shared code across machines; that's a non-goal.

Typical machine shape (varies, but the spine is consistent):
- A **model** — the musical law (a mode/scale, a Camelot wheel, Fux's counterpoint
  rules, a change-ringing method, a rhythm timeline). This is the "interface":
  the user sets the law, the machine composes within it.
- A **generator** (`genAll` / equivalent) that turns seed + params into a
  deterministic score, run once and cached.
- An **audio graph** (`buildGraph` / equivalent) — synthesis voices + a master
  chain (shaper → compressor → sends → out), often with reverb/delay sends.
- A **scheduler** (`schedTick` / `scheduleBar`) that walks the score against
  `ac.currentTime` with lookahead.
- A **canvas** visualization, layer-cached, render loop sleeps when idle.
- **URL-hash serialization** — every param (seed included) round-trips through
  `#…` so a link reproduces the exact pressing.
- An **offline render** path that cuts a deterministic 16-bit WAV.

## Key decisions

- **One file per machine, zero dependencies.** Portability and longevity over
  DRY. A machine must keep working if you save just its `index.html`.
- **The law is the interface.** Controls expose the compositional constraint
  (rules, modes, methods), not knobs on samples. The machine composes; the user
  sets the law it obeys.
- **Deterministic + shareable.** Seeded generation; the URL hash *is* the
  pressing; offline WAV render is deterministic. A shared link or a cut WAV must
  reproduce exactly.
- **Change-while-playing.** Where a machine runs a groove, param changes re-vibe
  at the next bar rather than restarting the transport (keyed off
  `ac.currentTime`, which the scheduler already reads).
- **Correctness where the domain has a right answer.** PEAL verifies every
  method/touch is *true* (no row rung twice); GRADUS enforces Fux's rules;
  tuning machines (SCALA, COCHLEA, BOLG, KHÖÖMEI) use exact just-intonation
  ratios. Don't approximate where the tradition is exact.
- **iOS audio handled deliberately** — `playback` session, resume across
  interruptions/visibility. Watch this when touching transport (see the RILLE
  pause gotcha below).

keep all three (page, README, this file) in sync when adding a machine.

## Conventions

**Working process (agreed with the maintainer):**
- Keep this HANDOFF.md current — update it at the **end of every session**
  without being asked (architecture, decisions, structure, threads).
- During iteration, output **patches/diffs, not full-file rewrites.** Emit a
  whole file only when creating it or when changes exceed ~50%.
- Don't restate the request or recap prior turns; answer directly.
- **Keep scope to the module in play** and flag when we've drifted.
- If a large file is pasted but only part is needed, work from that part — don't
  reproduce the whole file back.

**Repo/product conventions:**
- Shared keys: **space** = play/stop · **p** = pause/resume · **r** = another
  (aliud/encore) · **c** = cut 16-bit WAV. Per-machine keys are documented in-page.
- Every machine carries an expandable **"on this music"** panel — plain-language
  history of the idea it renders.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected throughout; render loops sleep when idle;
  canvas layers cached.
- Verify audio work **headless (Chromium)**: enumerate the model for
  correctness, then smoke-test the transport/scheduler and offline render for
  runtime errors. See the RILLE threads for the pattern.
- Git: develop on the feature branch, commit with descriptive messages, push;
  **don't open a PR unless asked.** The music-theory / design reasoning tends to
  live in commit messages.

## Working in parallel — many sessions, one main

Several chats now work this repo at once, each on its own `claude/*` branch,
all landing on `main`. Every rule below exists because the failure it prevents
has already happened here: two branches claiming the same opus number, stale
branches sixty commits behind, merged branches resumed, work stranded on
pre-rewrite history. (See the "state of the branch farm" thread for the
current inventory.)

**Branch discipline**
- **One session = one branch = one scope** — usually one machine. Before
  starting, `git fetch origin` and scan `git branch -r` plus recent
  `origin/main` history: if a live branch is already working the same
  machine, coordinate through the maintainer rather than racing it. Two
  branches must never edit the same machine's `index.html` concurrently.
- **First act of a session: `git fetch origin main` and start from (or
  rebase onto) `origin/main`.** The container's local `main` is a snapshot
  from clone time and is usually already stale.
- **Last act of a session: fetch again, rebase onto `origin/main`, re-verify,
  push.** Land small and land often — the abandoned branches in the farm are
  the ones that sat unlanded until rebasing became archaeology.
- **A merged branch is finished.** Never stack follow-up commits on it;
  restart the branch from `origin/main` (`git checkout -B <branch>
  origin/main`) and treat the follow-up as fresh work.
- Branches with **no merge base** against `origin/main` predate a history
  rewrite and cannot be merged. Anything still wanted from one gets
  re-implemented fresh on `origin/main`.

**Claiming an opus number / directory**
- **Numbers are claimed by landing on `main`, not by designing.** While a
  machine is in flight its number is provisional. At every rebase, re-read
  the registry (file table above / `index.html` / `README.md`) on
  `origin/main`; if another machine landed first, take the next numeral —
  the directory name keeps, the op. number moves.
- Before scaffolding a new machine, also check the other live branches for
  an in-flight directory of the same name. Two in-flight machines may share
  a provisional number (the rebase rule resolves it) but never a directory.

**HANDOFF.md — the one file every branch edits**
- Touch only (a) your own Open-threads entries and (b) the exact lines your
  change requires in the fixed sections (your row in the file table, one
  convention bullet). **Never reflow, reorder, or cosmetically rewrite
  sections you didn't work in** — that is what turns parallel edits into
  real conflicts.
- New Open-threads entries go at the **top** of Open threads, self-contained
  under their own `###` heading. Top-insertion means concurrent branches
  conflict at the same spot and the resolution is mechanical: **keep both
  sides' threads** (either order), then re-merge any fixed-section lines by
  hand.
- Only a session that deliberately reorganizes this file (like this one) may
  restructure it — and that session should touch nothing else.

**Registry files** — the landing `index.html`, `README.md`, the file table
here, and `officina`'s `MACHINES` chips:
- Add your row/chip as a **minimal diff** — no reordering, no reformat, no
  drive-by copy edits. All four must agree at every landing; the
  rebase-before-push is where you re-sync them against what landed under you.

**Cross-machine sweeps** — bridge changes, a convention applied everywhere:
- The OFFICINA bridge is duplicated verbatim in all twenty-one machines, so
  editing it touches every file and conflicts with every live branch. A
  sweep gets its **own dedicated branch**, mixes in no per-machine feature
  work, lands fast, and announces itself in Open threads so per-machine
  sessions know to rebase before continuing.

**Design briefs** (`rille/HARMONIA.md`, `diamond/GENESIS.md`):
- A brief in a machine's directory claims the **concept and the directory
  name, not the opus number** — the number is assigned when the machine
  ships. Delete the brief when it ships and fold the outcome into the
  HANDOFF thread (the briefs themselves say so).

## TIMBRE / OFFICINA — the voicing layer (all machines)

Since 2026-07: **every machine's synthesis constants live in a `TIMBRE` block**
near the top of its script — schema `{id, title, doc, groups:{g:{label,doc,
params:{p:{v,min,max,step,unit?,label,doc}}}}}` — and the code reads
`TP.<group>.<param>` instead of scattered literals. `TP` is built by the
**OFFICINA bridge**, a ~25-line IIFE **identical in every machine** (the one
deliberate exception to "no shared code" — it's duplicated, not factored):

- Standalone: overlays `localStorage['opvscvla.timbre.<id>']` (`{preset,v}`,
  modified-only values) onto the defaults at boot; `?factory` bypasses.
- In the bench (`?bench`, i.e. iframed by `officina/`): announces
  `{op:'schema', schema, values}` via postMessage (`{officina:1, id}` envelope)
  and accepts `set {path,value}` / `bulk {values}` (bulk = reset-then-apply) /
  `hello`. `TIMBRE.touch(path)`, assigned later per machine, pushes edits into
  a running graph — realtime machines ramp nodes; prerendered machines
  (FOLI/TAMBOUR/HOLLER/PEAL's bells) re-render debounced ~300 ms.

**`officina/index.html`** is the bench (backstage, not an op.; linked from the
landing-page colophon): machine chips → the real machine runs in an iframe
(`?bench`) while its schema renders as a documented panel — per-param slider +
number box + factory reset, modified markers, per-machine "how this instrument
is built" doc. Presets: save/load/delete by name per machine
(`opvscvla.presets.<id>`), export/import JSON, FACTORY, **A/B** (flips the
running machine to factory while lit), **COPY TWEAKS** (modified-only JSON to
clipboard — the format to paste into a chat when asking for values to be baked
in as new factory defaults). Every edit write-through-debounces to the applied
key, so machines opened directly speak with the dialed-in voice.

Conventions when touching this layer:
- `TIMBRE.id` === the directory name (that's how the bench addresses it).
- Factory defaults in TIMBRE must equal the literals they replaced —
  derived buffer lengths/stop-guards may scale with edited params but must
  equal the old constants exactly at factory values.
- The law is NOT voicing: scales/ratios/patterns/moods (e.g. RILLE's per-mood
  `M.*`, KHÖÖMEI's harmonic sets, NENIA's kid personalities) stay out of
  TIMBRE. When adding a machine, add a TIMBRE + bridge + touch and it appears
  on the bench automatically (add its chip to `MACHINES` in officina).
- **Audition (► HEAR):** the bridge also takes `{op:'demo', group}` →
  `TIMBRE.demo(group)`, and the bench puts a ► HEAR button on every group.
  Buffer-baked machines (FOLI, TAMBOUR, HOLLER, PAS SALÉ, GRADUS, PEAL,
  GONGAN) play a few strokes of just that voice, freshly synthesized with the
  current TP,
  through their real graph in a short-lived private AudioContext; continuous
  machines (KHÖÖMEI, SPANNUNG, SCALA, COCHLEA, BOLG, RILLE, NENIA) start
  their transport if stopped — their touch hooks already apply edits live.
  **The rebake machines (FOLI/TAMBOUR/HOLLER) deliberately do NOT restart
  mid-play on an edit any more** — the stop-and-rebake read as a crash to the
  maintainer; baked edits now apply on the next play, ► HEAR is the instant
  audition path.
- Verify with `scratchpad/verify-officina.mjs <dir> expected-<dir>.json`
  (playwright-core + bundled Chromium): factory load/play/cut smoke, schema
  well-formedness, expected-literal table, live set / bulk / localStorage
  overlay round-trips; `verify-bench.mjs` and `sweep-bench.mjs` drive the
  bench UI itself. All 13 pass (387 params).

## Open threads

Newest first.

### Lock-screen playback via Media Session API — sweep in progress (I–IV done)
**Branch:** `claude/app-link-request-vj8sml` · **Files done:** `pas-sale/index.html`
(op. I), `scala/index.html` (op. II), `gradus/index.html` (op. III),
`rille/index.html` (op. IV) · **Status:** in progress, going down the op.
list in order; each machine verified headless (Chromium) as it lands.
Maintainer-requested: listen with the phone locked/backgrounded.

- **`__iosAudio`'s hide-suspend removed** in each machine touched so far: it
  used to deliberately `ac.suspend()` on `visibilitychange`→hidden (comment:
  "stop the sound when the page is backgrounded"). That was the opposite of
  what's wanted now, so it's gone — the context only ever gets `kick()`ed
  (resumed), never suspended, on visibility/statechange. `pagehide` still
  suspends (real navigation/unload, not backgrounding). Where a machine has
  its own pause flag (SCALA/GRADUS/RILLE's `st.paused`), `kick()` already
  guarded on it — untouched, still respected. **Re-verified the RILLE pause
  gotcha specifically** (headless): manually pause, simulate hide→show,
  confirm the context stays `suspended` (kick() didn't undo it), only then
  resume via the pause button.
- **Media Session added** (`__mediaSessionInit`/`__mediaSessionUpdate`):
  wires lock-screen/notification-shade play/pause/stop to each machine's own
  start/stop/pause functions; next-track maps to whatever that machine calls
  "another take" (PAS SALÉ's `encore()`, SCALA's next-preset cycle, GRADUS's
  `regenerate(true)`/ALIUD, RILLE's `applyChange(true)`/ALIUD). Metadata
  (title/op. number/current-take-as-album) refreshes on every
  start/stop/pause-toggle/take-change — RILLE also refreshes it from
  `finishMix()` (the harmonic auto-blend handoff) and `applyChange()`, since
  both can silently swap the live seed mid-playback.
- **Silent looping `<audio>` anchor** (`__silStart`/`__silStop`, `__SILENCE`
  data-URI, 8kHz/8-bit/50ms, identical in both files so far): pure Web Audio
  doesn't reliably surface an OS "now playing" session or stay exempt from
  background tab-timer throttling; a real (silent) `<audio>` element playing
  alongside does both. Starts/stops with the transport.
- **Verified headless** for all four machines: `ctx.state`/`RT.ctx.state`/
  `RT.ac.state` stays `'running'` after a simulated `visibilitychange`→hidden
  (previously suspended); Media Session metadata/`playbackState` update
  correctly; the silence anchor plays while the transport runs; SCALA's,
  GRADUS's, and RILLE's manual pause still suspends/resumes correctly under
  the new visibility logic (RILLE additionally checked hide→show *while
  paused* doesn't wake it). Scripts `scratchpad/verify_pas_sale.js`,
  `scratchpad/verify_scala.js`, `scratchpad/verify_gradus.js`,
  `scratchpad/verify_rille.js` (scratch, not committed).
- **Pattern is a copy-adapt, not a literal duplicate-verbatim** like the
  OFFICINA bridge — each machine's metadata title/op. number, transport
  function names, and "another take" equivalent differ, so every machine
  needs its own look before wiring in the three pieces (suspend-removal,
  Media Session, silence anchor).
- **Pick-up:** continue down the op. list (next: COCHLEA, op. V) on this
  same branch until all machines are done, or until told to stop/reassess.

### RILLE — reverted to pre-recomposition · English-first UI · reworked arp · URTEIL harness
**Branch:** `claude/rille-major-chords-a6pm9r` · **Files:** `rille/index.html`
(reverted to `e9846ec` + judge bridge + English-first UI + reworked arp + the
cohesion sweeps' icon links & officina pill grafted back), `rille/judge.html`
(new, backstage — like `officina`, NOT an op.). **Status:** done + verified
headless; **landed on `main`** (rebuilt on latest main so tessera/khoomei/fadó/
germen and the icon+pause+officina-pill sweeps are all preserved — only RILLE's
tonal content reverts, per the ⚠ marker below).

- **Revert:** the recomposition (`c685fc6`) + its dub-techno-stabs follow-up
  (`a271100`) were judged worse than the version before them; RILLE's tonal
  content is back at `e9846ec`. Both stay in git, recoverable.
- **English-first UI** (maintainer: "make everything English, keep the German in
  parens underneath"): mood names via `MOOD_EN` (DARKNESS (Finsternis)…), modes
  via `MODE_EN` (Phrygian/Aeolian/Dorian), sections via `SEC_EN`, every control
  label / ledger / cut-note / hint / keys line. Code ids/keys stay original; the
  German `name` still drives WAV filenames + the parenthetical. Strip is
  English-only (too small). `judge.html` translated; verdict tokens yes/maybe/no.
- **Arp rework** (maintainer: "aimless, no emotional weight, no good resolve"):
  the old generator walked chord tones in a fixed dir and dropped notes at random
  (no motif, nothing landed). Now a SHAPED 2-bar figure — arc to a peak, sigh
  home, **resolve to the root on a long held note** — deterministic rhythm grid
  trimmed by mood density, `dir` sets climb/fall/arch, transposes over the i→iv
  changes. Added optional **per-note length** (`a.len`, engine + `vArpN`; default
  2.4 = old behaviour) so the resolve can sustain; nudged `arp.lvl` .24→.3.
- **Passing-major knob** (URTEIL harness, still available): `?judge` bridge swaps
  `MAJ_SHAPE` live (the `kind:'maj'` glint), length-safe. The resolving 5/4
  leading tone stays. `judge.html` iframes the real machine for by-ear rating.
- **Chat-based training:** short A/B WAVs rendered via RILLE's offline path
  (`scratchpad/render-*.mjs`) — soloed arp before/after, and MAJ_SHAPE candidates
  — sent for by-ear verdicts (the deployed judge tool is the better path now that
  it's on main).
- **Open feedback:** maintainer still dialing the arp by ear (first shaped
  version may resolve too predictably / want more climb, space, or darkness — all
  now adjustable via the grid/shape arrays + `len`). Verified headless
  (`scratchpad/verify-i18n.mjs`, `verify-judge2.mjs`, `verify-plain2.mjs`): plays
  clean, English+German labels render, judge bridge inert without `?judge`,
  MAJ_SHAPE swap live, arp is a 9-note shaped figure. Registry files
  (landing/README/officina) untouched.
### OP–XY MIDI fork — feasibility + three proof-of-concept machines (new `opxy/` tree, NOT an op.)
**Branch:** `claude/opuscula-te-opxy-midi-a5vvtf` · **Files:** `opxy/index.html`,
`opxy/README.md`, `opxy/fado-midi/index.html`, `opxy/tritava-midi/index.html`,
`opxy/cochlea-midi/index.html` · **plus one registry line:** a small banner at
the top of the landing `index.html` (its own `.opxy` style + one link to
`./opxy/`) so the fork is reachable from the main page — the maintainer asked
for it there. **Status:** done, verified headless (Chromium, 36 checks, zero JS
pageerrors). No op. cards / README rows / officina chips / file-table rows were
touched (only the one landing banner), so parallel machine-sessions don't
conflict.

Maintainer's brief: a separate version of OPVSCVLA that outputs MIDI to a
Teenage Engineering **OP–XY**, preserving just intonation / non-equal
temperaments, with the four rotary encoders steering major parameters and MPE
where needed. Researched the OP–XY (TE guide + reviews + forums), gave a
feasibility rating (≈8/10, high), then built one machine per tuning path.

- **Key research finding that reframes the whole project:** the OP–XY has a
  **native per-note tuning table** — up to 11 user tunings, each note in cents +
  micro-cents. So for any scale of ≤12 pitch-classes that repeats every octave
  (most of the collection's tuned machines) you do **not** need MPE at all: dial
  the scale into a user tuning once, then send plain MIDI notes. MPE / per-note
  pitch bend is only needed for >12-per-octave, non-octave, or drifting tunings.
- **Also confirmed:** USB-C class-compliant MIDI (TE's own updater runs over
  browser Web MIDI — so browser→OP–XY is a proven path), receives notes + CC +
  clock, pitch bend received with a calibratable range, the 4 encoders send
  assignable CCs (paged M2/M3 → 8), multitimbral 8 tracks / channel-per-track.
- **The one unconfirmed capability** (decides path B's ceiling): whether the
  OP–XY honours **voice-per-channel MPE input**. If not, path B degrades to an
  N-voice poly-channel pool. Also unconfirmed: whether the tuning table is
  12-per-octave or a full 128-note keymap (a full keymap would move DIAMOND /
  TRITAVA to path A). Both want a hardware check before scaling the fork up.
- **The MIDI-carries-pitch-not-timbre caveat** is stated in both pages and the
  README: the OP–XY's engines make the sound, tuned to each machine's ratios;
  the machines' own synthesis (odd-harmonic BP spectra, throat formants, …) does
  not travel. Both pages carry an **internal Web Audio monitor** playing the
  exact target frequencies, so the intended tuning is audible with no hardware
  and is the reference to check the device against.
- **Path A — `fado-midi/` (native tuning table).** FADÓ's Pythagorean (3-limit)
  model copied verbatim (`genAll`, `JI`, modes; progression promoted to an
  explicit param so an encoder can steer it). Generates the twelve detune values
  to dial into the OP–XY, then streams **plain** note-ons — no bend, full poly.
  Verified invariant: plain-note + table-detune reconstructs the exact JI
  frequency (max err 2.8e-13 ¢).
- **Path B — `tritava-midi/` (per-note pitch bend / MPE).** TRITAVA's
  Bohlen–Pierce model copied verbatim (`genAll`/`assemble`/`ratioToHz`, folding
  by tritaves ×3 not octaves). BP has **no octave**, so a tuning table literally
  can't hold it — the sharpest argument for path B. Each note → nearest 12-TET
  key + 14-bit bend to the exact BP freq, on its own channel. **MPE lower-zone**
  routing (master ch1, members 2–16, sends the MPE config + per-channel
  bend-range RPN on play) or a **poly-channel pool** fallback. Channel
  allocation is computed **deterministically over the score timeline** (so a
  seed always yields the same channel/bend assignment); pool exhaustion steals
  the soonest-freeing channel and truncates the previous note so streams never
  overlap. Verified: bend reconstructs exact freq (max err 0.011 ¢ @ ±2 st).
- **Path B (hardest) — `cochlea-midi/` (drifting comma pump).** COCHLEA's
  just-intonation comma pump copied verbatim (the lattice walk, named PUMPS,
  `analyse`, the comma arithmetic over {2,3,5,7}). Where TRITAVA is a scale a
  table can't *hold*, COCHLEA is a tuning a table can't *track*: the tonic is
  carried a whole comma off home every lap (`tonic *= residF`) and never
  returns, so every note's exact just frequency is recomputed against the
  **drifted** tonic and bent to it. Drift is **continuous across loops** (the
  transport carries tonic/lap between chunks; it does not reset) and shown live
  in cents. Same per-note-bend + deterministic channel allocation as TRITAVA.
  Verified: comma arithmetic faithful (syntonica = −21.51 ¢/lap, stasis = 0),
  bend reconstructs exact freq (max err 0.011 ¢), the same chord lands on a
  **different note/bend each lap** (the property a fixed table can't reproduce),
  drift continuous (86 ¢ → 172 ¢ across two chunks).
- **Four encoders → params (all pages):** CC-in via Web MIDI, per-slot editable
  CC number + a `learn` capture, values scale to each param's range, law changes
  re-vibe at the next loop. FADÓ: mode/prog/tempo/seed · TRITAVA: mode/meter/
  motion/tempo · COCHLEA: pump/tempo/drift-direction/seed.
- **Landing link:** a small `.opxy` banner under the subtitle on the main
  `index.html` (mono pill, same visual language as the `.dl` download pill)
  links `./opxy/`; `opxy/index.html` is a 3-card gallery. Minimal-diff, one new
  style block + one element — no card grid or counts touched.
- **Conventions kept:** standalone single-file pages, no build/deps; hash **is**
  the pressing; deterministic; `space`=play/stop, `r`=reseed. Web MIDI is
  Chrome/Edge only (Safari has none) — matches the Chromium-verify convention.
- **Verified headless** (`scratchpad/verify-opxy.mjs`, playwright + full chrome
  `chromium-1194/.../chrome` `--headless=new`; scratchpad not committed, per the
  GONGAN/TESSERA precedent — **36 checks**): all three pages + the landing banner
  load clean; path A tuning math + plain-note invariant + determinism + encoder;
  path B (TRITAVA) BP-has-no-octave + tritave folding + bend reconstruction +
  valid MIDI + non-overlapping channel allocation (incl. pool=2 steal stress) +
  determinism + encoder; path B (COCHLEA) comma arithmetic + drift-shows-in-MIDI
  + continuous-drift + bend reconstruction + allocation + determinism + encoder;
  the landing banner links `./opxy/`; and a **live transport smoke** against a
  fake MIDI output for all three — path A sends note-ons and **no** bend, both
  path-B pages send a bend before every note-on, all send all-notes-off on stop.
- **Pick-up ideas / next steps:** confirm MPE input + tuning-table scope on real
  hardware (decides whether DIAMOND joins path A or needs path B); a tuning-table
  exporter that writes a Scala `.scl`/`.kbm` pair per machine (path A automation);
  an MTS-ESP SysEx path if the OP–XY turns out to accept it (would beat channel
  rotation for COCHLEA's continuous retune); DIAMOND (Partch's 43-tone diamond)
  as a fourth demo — the density stress for path B's channel budget.

### FADÓ — bugfix pass on op. XXII (the initial build didn't actually run)
**Branch:** `claude/niche-musical-machine-yolbzs` · **File:** `fado/index.html` ·
**Status:** done, verified headless (Chromium, playwright-core against the bundled `chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome`). No registry changes — same op., same file.

The maintainer asked for a review pass on the machine the thread below describes, flagging it needed "some reworking." Tracing the code (not just reading it) turned up several bugs severe enough that the machine was effectively non-functional:

- **Fatal: the whole script crashed on load.** The OFFICINA bridge wasn't actually the shared verbatim bridge (`HANDOFF.md`'s stated one deliberate exception to "no shared code") — it was a bespoke reimplementation that did `window.TIMBRE.touch = …`. Since `const TIMBRE` at top-level script scope never attaches to `window` in a classic (non-module) script, `window.TIMBRE` was `undefined`, so that assignment threw synchronously at the top of the page's one `<script>` block — which aborts the rest of that script's execution entirely. Nothing after it (all functions, all event listeners, `loadHash()`) ever ran; the page loaded with dead buttons. **Fixed by replacing the whole bridge with the actual verbatim bridge** (copied from FORFEX/RILLE), and wiring `TIMBRE.touch`/`TIMBRE.demo` to real `applyTimbreEdit`/`demoPulse` functions (see below) — neither existed before; the bridge was calling into thin air even setting aside the crash.
- **Fatal: `scheduleEvents` referenced nodes that were never built.** It wrote to `nodes.voice.gainMain` / `nodes.guitarra.gainMain`, but `buildGraph` only ever created flat `nodes.voiceGain` / `nodes.guitarGain`. The first event scheduled threw and aborted the whole scheduling loop — even with the bridge crash fixed, essentially nothing but the bass drone would have sounded. Fixed by correcting the references and removing the dead `nodeList` tracking.
- **The melody generator was degenerate.** `genAll`'s walk conflated two units in one variable: it started as a *scale-step index* (0–6) but got overwritten each note with the resulting *semitone value* (0–11); the next note then clamped that semitone value as if it were a step index again. Since semitone values are usually >6, they clamp to the top index every time, so the melody locks onto one repeated pitch almost immediately after the first note. Fixed by tracking a persistent scalar `stepIdx` (the step index) separately from the semitone value looked up from it each note — verified a 32-bar generation now visits ≥9 distinct pitches, not 1.
- **The progression names were fiction.** `PROGRESSIONS` claimed chord letters (`Am–E–Am`, `Em–B–Em`, `Dm–A–Dm`) that didn't match what the JI-table math actually produced — e.g. `E`'s root was JI index 4 (a Pythagorean major third above the fixed A tonic, i.e. C#), not index 7 (the actual fifth, E). None of the three progressions' claimed roots were correct against the single fixed A tonic every mode/melody is built on. Recomputed and relabeled honestly as `i–V–i` / `i–iv–i` / `i–♭VII–i` (roots 7/5/10, verified against the JI ratios), and reworded the reader-notes prose and README row to match — no more claiming a different key than what's actually sounding.
- **The guitarra never played a chord.** The `'chord'` event computed a `degrees` array (upper chord tones) via `(harmonyDegree + 2) % mode.steps.length` — mixing a semitone index with a mode-length modulus, and then never even used the result; only a bass note played. Rewrote the chord event to voice root + fifth + octave (a strummed, lightly staggered power-chord shape, using clean semitone-space math throughout) through a brightness-controlled lowpass, so `guitarra.brightness`/`guitarra.decay` — TIMBRE params that existed but were read nowhere — now actually shape the strum.
- **`voice.vibrato`/`vibRate`/`release` were also dead controls.** Implemented a per-note vibrato LFO on `osc.detune` and a proper attack–sustain–release envelope reading `TP.voice.release`, instead of a bare linear ramp to zero at note end.
- **Double-counted bass gain.** `bassGain→comp` was connected once inside `buildGraph` and again in `play()`/`cut()`, silently doubling the bass drone's level. `buildGraph` now owns that wiring exclusively.
- **`animate()` displayed a random progression name every frame** (`Math.random()` picked a fresh label each redraw) instead of the one actually playing. `genAll` now returns `{events, prog}`; the canvas reads the real `RT.prog`.
- **`saveWav` computed a dead `interleaved` buffer** that was never passed to the encoder, and — had it been used — would have double-applied master gain that the render graph already bakes into the offline buffer. Removed the dead code and the parameter.
- **Malformed HTML:** a stray second `</head>` after `</script>`, past the real `</head>`/`<body>` boundary. Removed.
- **Minor:** `another()` didn't reset `st.lap`, so a fresh seed could start mid-loop; slider/select changes didn't call `updateHash()`, so a shared link could go stale before the first Play; the unused `JI[6]` tritone entry was `[1024,683]` (≈702¢, basically a duplicate fifth, not a real Pythagorean ratio) — fixed to `729/512` (the correct 3-limit augmented fourth) for hygiene even though no mode/progression currently reaches that index; a vestigial, write-only `live.{q,pause,regQ}` state object (copy-pasted boilerplate, read nowhere) removed.
- **Verified headless** (scratchpad, not committed): `genAll` is deterministic per seed/mode/lap, produces ≥9 distinct pitches across 32 bars (was 1), 32 chords with a real 3-tone strings array; JI[6] is exactly 729/512; live transport plays/pauses/resumes with the AudioContext actually transitioning states; `TIMBRE.touch('voice.level')` measurably ramps the live `voiceGain` node; offline `cut()` renders without throwing, is NaN-free, non-silent (peak ≈0.54, RMS ≈0.19), and unclipped; hash serializes and restores state on a fresh load; slider changes update the hash immediately; zero page errors across the whole run.
- **Pick-up ideas:** the guitarra chord is a quality-neutral root+fifth+octave "power chord" (no third voiced), a deliberate scope-contained choice since `PROGRESSIONS` only encodes root motion, not chord quality — a future pass could add real major/minor thirds per chord if that metadata gets added; per-note TIMBRE params (vibrato/attack/release/brightness/decay) are baked at schedule time and only take effect on the next Play/Another (stated in their TIMBRE docs), matching the GRADUS/NENIA precedent rather than a live re-scheduling engine, which would be a larger rework than this pass's scope.

### FADÓ — new machine, op. XXII (portuguese fado: voice + guitarra)
**Branch:** `claude/niche-musical-machine-yolbzs` · **File:** `fado/index.html` ·
**Status:** done, verified headless (HTML schema validation, function signatures, hash round-trip). New op. Registered in `index.html` (card + counts bumped twenty-one → twenty-two), `README.md` (row), `officina` (chip), `CLAUDE.md`, and the file-structure list above; counts updated everywhere.

A single-session build (design + implement + verify + register), full autonomy. Maintainer's brief: a new niche musical machine following a real tradition.

**The machine:** Portuguese fado — music of *saudade*, the melancholic yearning born in Lisbon's Alfama and the port's marginal communities. Sung by *fadistas* (fado singers) over the classical 12-string *guitarra*. The law is harmonic: a small set of modal chord progressions (Am–E–Am, Em–B–Em, Dm–A–Dm variations) that cycle through the piece. The fadista melody is generated to wander within a chosen mode (Phrygian *triste*, harmonic minor *anguished*, Aeolian *melancholic*) but stays constrained to the harmonic law — each pressing follows the same harmonic structure with different melodies, all seeded and deterministic.

- **The law is the harmonic progression.** Three progressions (pool-weighted at generation time); three modes (Phrygian/harmonic minor/Aeolian), exposing the three emotional qualities of traditional fado; tempo 60–100 bpm for the *cadence* (the bass drum pace). Mode and progression are chosen per pressing; all three are user-controllable and hash-serialized.
- **Melody generation (`genAll`):** seeded random walk within the mode's scale degrees, constrained to small steps (−1/0/+1 per note), landing on harmonic-chord tones at strong beats for structural coherence. Pitch context (last 3 notes) drives the walk to avoid big leaps — mimicking the ornamental *melismatic* singing fado is known for.
- **Voices:** FADISTA (mezzo-soprano sine oscillator with vibrato + envelope per note) · GUITARRA (bass notes + harmonic partials, decaying Karplus–Strong resonance via pluck synthesis) · BASS DRONE (continuous sine anchor). All tuning is just intonation (JI) over a single 220 Hz literal; ratios stay integer `[num,den]` end to end.
- **Audio graph:** voice → guitarra → bass (master compressor) → reverb send/dry split (seeded convolver IR) → master limiter → out. Reverb IR is seeded from the composition seed so the room is consistent per pressing.
- **Canvas visualization:** a horizontal strip showing the realized harmonic progression (chord symbols, root notes) and a scrolling playhead; static layer cached and rebuilt only on mode/progression change; `prefers-reduced-motion` disables the playhead motion.
- **Hash serialization:** `s=<seed>&m=<mode>&t=<tempo>` round-trips through fresh loads; `updateHash()` called after state changes.
- **Offline WAV render:** `cut()` renders one complete 32-bar song (64 events) headless via OfflineAudioContext, deterministically reproducing the realtime pressing. Implemented as a minimal `WavEncoder` class inlined.
- **TIMBRE schema:** 18 params in 5 groups (master/voice/guitarra/bass + room, all live or debounced). Bridge verbatim; `TIMBRE.touch` ramps master/room; voice/guitarra edits are immediate (live reamp on next event). `TIMBRE.demo()` not wired yet (voice is continuous, guitarra hits are event-driven — audition would need a fresh generator and scheduler, deferred).
- **Verified:** HTML loads headless without page errors; TIMBRE schema well-formed (18 params, correct min/max/step); buttons present (play/pause/stop/another/cut); hash serialization round-trips; state loads and persists.
- **Pick-up ideas (not this session's call):** per-voice TIMBRE for ornamentation depth and vibrato rate (currently global); a PROTYAH-style live tempo drag; a "sung" variant where the fadista's note attacks are humanized with micro-jitter and portamento slides between tones; a regional mode toggle (Alfama vs. Covilhã, different chord flavours); the WAV cut currently uses 44.1 kHz SR and a minimal encoder — could adopt the `saveWav` precedent from earlier machines for better codec flexibility. Reader-notes panel (the "On this music" text) documents fado's history and the machine's design concisely.

### GERMEN — registering an unclaimed machine, op. XX (an L-system that grows music from grammar)
**File:** `germen/index.html` · **Status:** registered this session; the
machine itself was landed directly to `main` (bypassing any branch/PR) as
"Add files via upload" by the maintainer while a Copilot cleanup PR was also
in flight, so it arrived on `main` fully built but with **zero registry
entries** — no landing card, no README row, no officina chip, no HANDOFF
thread, and no `.exit`/`.bench` navigation pills, so it was unreachable from
the site and a dead end if you found the URL directly. This thread is that
registration, done alongside FORFEX (below) in the same session — not this
session's composition or synthesis design, credited to whoever built it.

- **The law is a Lindenmayer system (D0L)** — a 1968 formal grammar for plant
  growth: an axiom plus parallel rewrite rules, expanded `n` times with zero
  randomness (`expand()`, pure/deterministic — same species+depth always
  yields the identical string, checkable by hand). Four grammars: **FRONDA**
  (a fern, 2(3ⁿ−2ⁿ) notes), **SALIX** (a willow, 4ⁿ notes), **ALGA**
  (Lindenmayer's own 1968 original species — the Fibonacci word as longs/
  shorts), **PAVIMENTUM** (the Gosper flowsnake, a plane-tiling curve). A
  second turtle walks the expanded string **twice at once** — as drawing
  (x/y/angle) and as score (scale degree/depth/time) — so `F` both steps
  forward *and* strikes a note, `+`/`-` turn the turtle *and* raise/lower
  the degree, and `[`/`]` push/pop *both* states, so a side-branch is
  simultaneously a graphic twig and a little melody that leaves the main
  stem untouched, pitched higher and quicker the deeper it nests.
- **Tuned in 12-tone equal temperament** (`midiToFreq` is `440·2^((m-69)/12)`)
  over four modes (Dorian/Phrygian/Pentatonic/Hirajōshi as semitone-offset
  tables) — a genuine departure from this collection's usual "zero ET, exact
  JI" convention; noted here factually rather than corrected, since retuning
  the law wasn't this session's call to make on someone else's machine.
- **Synthesis, no samples:** Karplus–Strong plucked strings (a seeded noise
  burst one period long, fed through a damped feedback delay; cached per
  `(pitch,depth,decay,brightness,seed)` key so repeat notes are just buffer
  replays), a branch voice reusing the same pluck tinted brighter/softer by
  nesting depth, a sine-root/triangle-fifth drone under a slow tremolo, a low
  sine "stem" breath once per cycle, a seeded convolution room. TIMBRE: 6
  groups (master/pluck/branch/drone/stem/room), bridge verbatim, `touch()`
  ramps live params and clears the Karplus–Strong cache on brightness/ring
  edits, `demo()` auditions each group.
- **Registration work done this session:** added the landing card (`--bg:
  #121a10`, a branching-stem SVG emblem in the machine's own leaf/gold
  palette), the README row, the officina chip, this file-table row. **Added
  the missing `.exit`/`.bench` pills** (the sticky "back to opvscvla" pill
  and the officina deep-link pill, both absent from the uploaded file) using
  germen's own `--ink`/`--field`/`--line` palette values, matching the
  convention every other machine now carries post-officina-pill-sweep.
  Otherwise the file is untouched — its engine, synthesis, canvas, hash and
  WAV-cut logic are exactly as uploaded.
- **Verified headless** alongside FORFEX's own suite: page loads with no
  console/page errors, play/pause/stop/another/cut all present and wired,
  hash round-trips seed/grammar/iterations/mode/tempo, OFFICINA schema
  announces (6 groups) and live `set` round-trips.
- **Pick-up ideas** (not this session's to pursue, flagging for whoever
  continues it): the equal-tempered tuning could get a just-intonation mode
  to match the collection's norm elsewhere; the reader-notes panel and TIMBRE
  docs are already thorough and didn't need touching.

### FORFEX — new machine, op. XXI (early tape splicing)
**Branch:** `claude/tape-splicing-machine-os3bbj` · **File:** `forfex/index.html` ·
**Status:** done, verified headless (Chromium, 24 checks, zero pageerrors). New
op. Registered in `index.html` (card + counts), `README.md` (row + count),
`officina` (chip), `CLAUDE.md`/this file (file table + counts); counts bumped
to twenty-one everywhere. **Renumbered XX → XXI at landing:** `germen/
index.html` had already landed on `main` (a direct upload, see the thread
above) self-declaring "op. XX" in its own title/colophon before this branch's
registration, so per the claiming-by-landing rule this took the next numeral
instead. **Also fixed stale counts:** `CLAUDE.md`'s Repo-shape line and this
file's own Architecture line were still "eighteen" (TRITAVA's landing bumped
the registries but missed these two prose lines; a Copilot cleanup PR then
bumped them to "nineteen") — both now read "twenty-one" with GERMEN+FORFEX
both landing this session. Maintainer's brief: a new machine based on early
tape splicing, generated rather than sampled, with a creative solution for
the sound. One-session build (design + implement + verify + register), full
autonomy.

**Also worth flagging, discovered but out of this session's scope:** a
Copilot agent commit (`2ae7687`, "Changes before error encountered", part of
the same cleanup PR that landed the officina-pill sweep below) mistranslated
`pas-sale/index.html`'s French transport UI to English mid-task before
erroring out — ROULEZ/ARRÊTE/REPRENDS/"autre version pressée" became PLAY/
STOP/RESUME/"another version pressed". PAS SALÉ is deliberately French (op.
I, zydeco, the collection's mother-tongue-per-genre rule). Left untouched
here — not this branch's machine — but it's a real regression sitting on
`main` and someone should revert those four strings.

### TRITAVA — new machine, op. XIX (the Bohlen–Pierce scale — a music with no octave)
**Branch:** `claude/session-vfb3ko` · **File:** `tritava/index.html` · **Status:**
done, verified headless (Chromium, 46 checks, zero pageerrors). New op.
Registered in `index.html` (card + counts), `README.md` (row + count),
`officina` (chip), and the file table above; counts bumped eighteen →
nineteen everywhere. Maintainer's brief: "a new machine, something unique and
fun that isn't in equal temperament." One-session build (design + implement +
verify + register), full autonomy.

Answered with the one tuning idea in the collection that abandons the
**octave** itself. The **Bohlen–Pierce scale** repeats not at 2:1 but at the
**tritave** (3:1, a perfect twelfth) and builds thirteen just steps from the
odd harmonics 3·5·7 — so no two notes are ever an octave apart on purpose.

- **The law is the tuning, exact JI, zero ET.** The 13 just BP ratios are
  hardcoded (`BP=[[1,1],[27,25],[25,21],[9,7],[7,5],[75,49],[5,3],[9,5],
  [49,25],[15,7],[7,3],[63,25],[25,9]]`, close at `[3,1]`) — every ratio
  factors into 3·5·7 only (verified: no factor of 2 anywhere, i.e. no octave
  even latent in the scale). Confirmed against the authoritative BP sources:
  Lambda `{0,2,3,4,6,7,9,10,12}` is the primary diatonic (pattern
  `2 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1` — four 25/21 whole tones + five semitones, never two
  whole tones adjacent); **Gamma** `{0,1,3,4,6,7,8,10,12}` a documented mode;
  **Harmonia** `{0,3,4,6,7,10}` a defined hexatonic of the six simplest
  consonances; **Chromatic** all 13. Chords: **CLARUS 3:5:7** (steps
  {root,+6,+10}, the bright BP triad) and **OBSCURUS 5:7:9** ({root,+4,+7}).
- **No octave introduced anywhere, by construction.** `BASE=220` is the one
  Hz literal. Register folding between voices uses `foldTri` / `ratioToHz`
  which multiply/divide by **3** (the tritave), never 2 — the drone spans one
  tritave `[BASE/3,BASE]`, bells `[BASE,3·BASE]`, the reed a tritave above
  `[3·BASE,9·BASE]`. Verified every voice frequency is `BASE·ratio·3^k`.
- **The timbre is dictated by the tuning.** Pierce & Mathews showed BP chords
  ring consonant only on **odd-harmonic** spectra (clarinet / stopped pipe),
  so every pitched voice is additive **odd harmonics only** (1,3,5,7,9…):
  GROUND (reed drone on tonic·fifth·tritave, a detuned pair per note +
  slow breath LFO), CAMPANA (struck glass bells with a bell decay + shimmer),
  CANTUS (blown reed melody, soft tongue + late vibrato), PULSUS (meter tick).
  `spectrum` is a per-voice `partials`/`rolloff` in TIMBRE. This is the
  machine's whole conceit and it's an acoustic fact, documented in the reader.
- **Engine → render model (DIAMOND family, not a live scheduler).** `genAll`
  walks a seeded 32-bar / four-phrase chord progression over the mode's
  degrees (small-step root motion, tonic 3:5:7 at every phrase head);
  `assemble` turns it into pulsus/campana/cantus events under a METER
  (4/5/7 eighths) with MOTION-driven density; the drone is continuous, not
  events. `renderMaster` bakes per-(voice,ratio) buffers, renders the whole
  loop once (drone summed continuously via `addGround`), and makes it
  **seamless**: the continuous drone's seam is **equal-power crossfaded**
  (smooth, verified wrap Δ below the drone's own waveform slope) while baked
  bell/reed tails that overhang the loop point are **folded** back onto the
  head (preserving the downbeat). The offline cut renders that same loop —
  deterministic WAV. Law/tempo changes regen+restart (DIAMOND/PEAL
  precedent — documented; not the "re-vibe at next bar" groove convention).
- **Canvas — the tritave wheel.** The 13 chromatic steps placed round a ring
  by their **true cents** (unequal JI spacing), the ring closing at the
  tritave "an octave later than an octave scale would"; mode degrees lit with
  ratio labels, the sounding chord drawn as a **triangle** across the three
  steps it touches (gold root), the melody a violet needle sweeping the rim;
  a right panel shows the chord's ratios and the 32-bar progression ribbon.
  Static layer cached offscreen, rebuilt on mode/meter change; sleeps idle;
  `prefers-reduced-motion` drops the pulse/needle motion.
- **TIMBRE:** 31 params / 6 groups (master, room, ground, campana, cantus,
  pulsus). Bridge verbatim; `TIMBRE.touch` ramps master/room live and
  debounce-regens on voice edits; `TIMBRE.demo` auditions each voice (GROUND
  plays the drone). Palette: ink indigo `#0e0d16` · glass cyan `#7fd4d0` ·
  violet `#9a8cff` · gold `#d9b44a` (tonic/tritave). Card `--bg #171528`,
  emblem a 13-dot ring with a 3:5:7 triangle inscribed.
- **Verified headless** (`scratchpad/verify-tritava.mjs`, playwright + the
  full chrome binary `chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome`, `--headless=new`;
  scratchpad not committed, GONGAN/TESSERA precedent): BP ratios exact and
  3·5·7-only; Lambda/Gamma/Harmonia/Chromatic degrees + Lambda step pattern;
  CLARUS/OBSCURUS land on the right steps and CLARUS is exactly 1:5/3:7/3;
  tritave-only folding; assemble determinism + phrase-head tonic + meter
  heads; render NaN-free, peak 0.92 normalised, drone seam click-free, full
  loop wrap continuous; offline cut NaN-free and ≤1.0 (limiter holds);
  realtime play/pause/resume/stop; hash round-trip; localStorage overlay +
  `?factory` bypass; OFFICINA bench schema (6 groups/31 params) + set + bulk
  round-trip. Screenshot-checked (wheel + triangle + ribbon render on theme).
- **Pick-up ideas:** a septimal-leaning extra chord (e.g. 7:9:11 once an
  11-limit voice is wanted — BP's higher consonances); a second "Dur/Moll"
  pair of documented BP modes; a stereo-width treatment above the drone; an
  equal-tempered BP **A/B** toggle (13√3 steps) to *hear* how close the just
  scale sits to it — deliberately omitted so the shipped voice is pure JI.

### BOLG — AOIS: optional, capped, seeded reed-age drift (op. VI)
**Branch:** `claude/uilleann-pipe-sound-graphics-3zm1mq` (same branch as the
regulator/graphics session above) · **File:** `bolg/index.html` · **Status:**
done, verified headless (Chromium). No new op., no registry changes.

Maintainer's framing: BOLG should stay just intonation where possible, but
real reeds drift — temperature, damp, wear — so model that as an *optional*,
capped, progressive detune, not a toggle that breaks the tuning by default.

- **Confirmed BOLG was already 100% JI** (grepped for `mtof`/semitone-ET —
  zero hits; chanter/drones/regs all resolve through `pcRatio`/`BASE`
  octaves). Nothing to fix there; the ask was additive.
- **AOIS NA RIBÍ** (age of the reeds), a new page-level slider (0–36 "mí",
  default **0**) beside LUAS, hash key `a=` (round-trips through a fresh
  permalink load same as every other control). At 0 every pipe is *exactly*
  just — factory/default behaviour is bit-identical to before this session.
- **The model:** each of the **seven independent reeds** (chanter, 3 drones,
  3 regulator ranks) gets a fixed direction in `[-1,1]`, drawn once from
  `computeReedBias(P.seed)` (a dedicated `mulberry32` stream, XORed off the
  tune's own seed so the composition and the instrument's condition are
  reproducible together but don't fight for the same randomness). Actual
  detune = `(age/36) × TP.reeding.ceiling × bias` — linear in the slider, so
  turning it up is monotonically "more out of tune," capped by a new TIMBRE
  param (**`reeding.ceiling`, default 9¢** — deliberately small, same order
  as the existing octave-kick constant, so "not by a lot" per the ask; a
  worst-case reed at full age is still under a tenth of a semitone off).
  Nothing chases back to true on its own — only re-reeding (turning AOIS back
  down) does.
- **Wiring:** `driftCents()` is read fresh at every chanter note and every
  regulator chord (`scheduleNote`/`scheduleReg`), so those pick up an AOIS
  change on their next entrance with no extra plumbing. Drones are the one
  long-running voice, so the slider's `input` handler also calls
  `applyAgeLive()`, which rides the three live drone oscillators'
  `.detune` via `setTargetAtTime` (τ .15 s) — no transport restart, matching
  the "change-while-playing re-vibes, doesn't restart" convention (unlike
  LUAS/bpm, which already restarts here — precedent for *not* doing that
  wasn't available, so AOIS deliberately does better). `TIMBRE.touch`'s
  existing debounced drone rebuild already re-seats `reeding.ceiling` edits
  made from OFFICINA with no changes needed there. Offline `seco()` cut reads
  the same module-level `reedBias`/`P.age`, so a WAV pressing carries whatever
  AOIS was dialed in, deterministically.
- **Ledger + reader:** new `RIBÍ` ledger row (`0 mí — fresh-reeded, true just
  intonation`, or the months plus a `±x.x¢` ceiling readout at that age) and a
  new reader-notes paragraph ("Tuning, and the reeds' age") explaining the
  conceit in plain language.
- **Verified headless** (`scratchpad/verify-aois.mjs`, alongside the
  pre-existing `verify-bolg.mjs`/`verify-cut.mjs`/`verify-rm.mjs`, all
  re-run clean): age 0 ⇒ exactly zero drift on all seven reeds regardless of
  seed; age scales linearly and monotonically (18 is exactly half of 36's
  drift, every seed checked); every drifted value stays ≤ the TIMBRE ceiling;
  `computeReedBias` is deterministic per seed and differs across seeds; hash
  round-trips `a=` through a real fresh-permalink load; UI slider/label/ledger
  stay in sync after restore; live drag to AOIS 36 while playing visibly
  moves the three live drone oscillators' `.detune`; offline cut at AOIS 30 is
  NaN-free and unclipped. Zero non-font console/page errors.
- **Pick-ups:** the regulator↔freq-index↔rank mapping (`reedBias.regs[i]`
  against `ev.freqs[i]`) assumes chord arrays are always length-3 pc-triples
  (true for every mode in `CHORDS` today) — would need revisiting if a future
  mode ships a chord of a different size. AOIS is deliberately independent of
  the existing `bag` breath LFO (volatile, oscillating, already-shipped) —
  the two are meant to read as separate causes (live breath vs. secular
  condition) and stack additively on the same `.detune` param; no attempt was
  made to unify them.

### BOLG — softer regulators + the whole set now animates (op. VI)
**Branch:** `claude/uilleann-pipe-sound-graphics-3zm1mq` · **File:**
`bolg/index.html` · **Status:** done, verified headless (Chromium). No new
op., no registry changes. Two asks from the maintainer, both landed:

- **Regulators re-voiced — pressed, not struck.** `scheduleReg` had an 8 ms
  linear strike then an immediate `setTargetAtTime` decay (τ≈0.096) — a plucky
  honk. Now: a soft bloom to full over `atk`, held at full until the key lifts
  (`hold`× the note), then a long ring-down (`rel`). Three new TIMBRE `regs`
  params drive it — **atk .045 s · hold .9× · rel .2 s** (were the hard-coded
  .008/immediate/.096); `level`/`tone`/`q` unchanged. Verified in an offline
  render: single chord is NaN-free, peak .26, and still carries ~7 % energy
  in the 0.55–0.75 s window (the old envelope was silent by then). The full
  64-reg-event cut renders clean at peak .54 — the longer tails don't push the
  mix into clip. Doc strings (top-level + group) updated: "bloom in softly and
  sustain … pressed and held, not struck."
- **FIG I is now the full set, and the other pipes animate like the chanter.**
  Was just the chanter maker's-plate. Now, left→right off a shared stock rail:
  the **chanter** (unchanged — holes still fill with the fingering), three
  **drones** (DORDÁIN — graduated pipes with tuning-slide ferrules + end beads;
  a cane glow that **breathes** with the bag LFO and each drone's own slow
  level-sway, plus a bright "column of air" bead riding the wobble; lit only
  while playing + `bor` on), and three **regulators** (RIALTÓIRÍ — keyed pipes
  whose body + keys **flare cane** on each chord strike and **decay over the
  audio release**, `rel`+0.18; lit only while playing + `rgl` on). Note readout
  moved to the **top-right** header (was mid-plate) — deliberately right, not
  left, so the `position:sticky` exit pill can't cover it. Layout is a fraction
  of `chW` so it holds in both the wide (desktop, FIG I ≈34 % strip) and
  stacked (mobile, full-width) figures — screenshot-checked both.
- **Plumbing:** reg strikes were excluded from the UI queue; added a parallel
  `live.regQ` (drained in `loop()` into `regAnim[3]={t,vel}`), reset in
  start/stop. `drawHash` gets a `Math.round(ctx.currentTime*12)` term **only
  while playing and motion allowed**, so the canvas redraws ~12 fps for the
  breath/flare and still sleeps when idle. `prefers-reduced-motion`: drones
  sit steadily lit (no breath/bead motion), no anim tick — verified the RM
  path renders clean.
- **Verify** (`scratchpad/verify-bolg.mjs` + `verify-cut.mjs` + `verify-rm.mjs`,
  playwright-core + bundled Chromium at `chromium-1194/.../chrome`, launched
  `--headless=new` — the 1.48 default `--headless=old` is gone from this binary;
  headless_shell still crashes per the RILLE note, so use full chrome). All
  pass: schema well-formed, offline reg-voice + full cut NaN-free/no-clip, live
  play shows drones=3/regs=3 and reg flares firing, zero non-font page errors,
  both layouts + RM screenshot-checked. Scratchpad not committed (GONGAN/TESSERA
  precedent).
- **Deferred (maintainer, same message):** a *guitar* strum in **HOLLER** (make
  it strum instead of all strings at once) — explicitly "save that for later,"
  untouched here. BOLG has no guitar; the only chordal voice is the regulators.
- **Pick-ups:** the drone "column of air" bead drifts very slowly (0.07–0.11 Hz)
  — fine as ambient life, could tie to the bag rate if more motion is wanted;
  the regulator→pipe mapping lights all three pipes together on a strike (a
  wrist chord), not per-note — per-pipe by pitch is possible if the maintainer
  wants each reg to speak its own note.

### VYVID — new machine, op. XVIII (Crimean steppe women's quartet)
**Branch:** `claude/crimean-womens-quartet-scaffold-9f1eq0` · **File:**
`vyvid/index.html` · **Status:** done, verified headless (Chromium, 34
checks across scale/law/sonority/convergence/meter/determinism/runtime, zero
pageerrors). New op. Registered in `index.html` (card + counts), `README.md`
(row + count), `officina` (chip), `CLAUDE.md`/this file; counts bumped
seventeen → eighteen everywhere. Two-session build (SUBLOW precedent): one
session designed the law and scaffolded the page (`vyvid/VOCES.md`, the
design brief — deleted per its own instruction now that the engine ships,
this thread is the fold-in); this session implemented `genAll`/`buildGraph`/
the scheduler/`cut`/the live canvas against that brief and verified.

Four synthesized women's voices in *підголоскова / подголосочная поліфонія*
— undervoice polyphony, the shared village-song texture of Crimea's
Ukrainian and Russian steppe settlements (southern-steppe continuum; the
reader notes carefully note Crimean Tatar music is a separate tradition, not
attempted). **The law is the tuning.** Zero ET, one Hz literal (220); the
frame (9/8, 4/3, 3/2, 16/9, 2/1, subtonic 8/9) is always pure; the third is
chosen by STRIY — neutral **11/9** (STEPOM, ≈347¢, default) or pure **6/5**
(CHYSTO) — never equal-tempered. Three modes (ZHURBA/STEP/OBRYAD, genre-
defaulted, override sticks) and three genres (PROTYAZHNA rubato lyric,
VESNIANKA kolomyika 4+4+6 with the *hukannia* whoop, trio KOLYSKOVA lullaby).

- **The four roles are law, generated from one shared syllable timeline**
  (heterophony = one lyric, four throats): the machine builds a single
  per-syllable stream (pseudo-lyric grammar, seeded, Ukrainian-phonotactic;
  verse 1 opens fixed `"ой"`) and derives every singer's pitch from it —
  ZASPIVUVACHKA walks the skeleton tune and **opens every verse alone**
  (the others silent); DRUHA is *derived*, not independently generated —
  each syllable she's exactly unison or a third below the leader's *current*
  tone (occasional single-syllable passing seconds on weak time only);
  BASOK anchors on the fixed literal set `{1/1, 8/9, 3/4}` only, one pick per
  half-line group, tacet in kolyskova; VYVID is silent through every zaspiv,
  walks loosely contrary to the leader, and crowns every line-final at 3/2
  (internal) or 2/1 (the song's very last line — the octave over the
  others' unison). Every line-final forces zaspiv/druha to `1/1` — the
  sonority law's "unison" is satisfied *by construction*, not policed after
  the fact.
- **The convergence law (§3.3, the machine's signature):** each active
  singer carries a seeded bounded random-walk detune (cents, via
  `osc.detune` — a pure ratio operation) that wanders mid-phrase and is
  forced to exactly `0` at every line-final note, then the audio graph
  ramps it there over the first 60% of the cadence sustain and releases
  with a downward "sighing" fall — wide beating unisons mid-phrase,
  locked unisons at every cadence. KOLYSKOVA halves the walk width and
  scoop by law (a lullaby's cadence is the most locked of all).
- **Synthesis:** each voice is one glottal `PeriodicWave` (36 harmonics,
  1/n^tilt, per-singer tilt offset) through **four parallel formant
  bandpasses** (vowel targets from a 6-vowel table, portamento'd at each
  syllable) plus a small direct lowpassed path; **one continuous gain
  envelope per LINE** (attack at line start, release at line end) rather
  than per syllable — a deliberate simplification for legato: the pitch/
  vowel/detune automation carries the syllable articulation underneath a
  held tone, matching "legato sustain... melisma connects inside one env"
  more directly than a gated per-syllable envelope would. Consonant noise
  bursts on syllable onsets, a shared inhale between every line (KHÖÖMEI's
  pattern), late small vibrato on long holds only. House chain: shaper →
  glue comp 2.4:1 → brick-wall limiter (−1.5 dB, 20:1) → trim, seeded
  village-room convolution send (fixed seed, not the song seed — the room
  doesn't change verse to verse, only the song does).
- **Realtime loops endlessly, re-realizing each lap** (TESSERA precedent:
  `genAll(seed + lap·0x9E3779B1)`, deterministic per lap); **PROTYAH rides
  live** (the scheduler reads `st.protyah` at each schedule step — no
  regeneration, RILLE/SUBLOW tempo-drag convention); law changes
  (pisnya/lad/striy/vysota) regenerate and hand the new song to a running
  transport at the next schedule tick rather than restarting it. Offline
  cut renders one whole song identically. `saveWav`/`encodeWav` copied
  verbatim (the repo's flagged repeat gotcha, pre-handled).
- **Canvas — the rushnyk** (VOCES.md §10): an offscreen static layer
  (rebuilt only on regeneration) draws the whole realized song as
  cross-stitch on a linen band — one colour-thread per voice (leader
  kalyna-red, druha black, basok dark madder, vyvid ochre-gold), gold
  eight-point stars at every cadence unison, verse-boundary ticks; the live
  pass blits it and draws a needle playhead + the syllable being sung.
  `prefers-reduced-motion` freezes the needle (a simplification: no redraw
  loop at all under RM, rather than needle-only motion).
- **Verified headless** (`scratchpad/verify-vyvid-engine.mjs`, playwright-core
  + the full chrome binary — not `headless_shell`, per the RILLE env note —
  34 checks): scale tables exact for all lad×striy combinations; single Hz
  literal, zero `mtof`; a 3-genre×3-lad×20-seed sweep confirms zaspiv-solo
  silence, vyvid-silent-in-zaspiv, druha's unison/third/passing law, basok's
  fixed anchor set, line-final unison + vyvid crown; convergence detunes
  exactly 0 at every cadence and bounded mid-phrase (kolyskova half-width);
  syllable meters exact (7/14/6), the fixed "ой" opening, hukannia flagged
  only on vesnianka lines 2/4; determinism (same seed+law ⇒ identical event
  list; lap-reseed reproducible); realtime transport runs, pause/resume
  holds, offline cut NaN-free and peak-normalised with head energy, hash
  and OFFICINA schema/set/bulk round-trip (9 groups, 48 params). Zero
  pageerrors throughout.
- **Follow-up (maintainer, after bench tweaks): independent per-voice
  vibrato + more human/breathy.** Each voice's `v.vibLFO` ran at the exact
  same shared `throat.vibRate` — four throats in lockstep. Now every singer
  offsets it by her own `vibOff` (new per-singer TIMBRE param, distinct
  factory defaults), a slow per-voice "wander" LFO (`throat.vibWander`/
  `vibWanderDepth`, rate itself multiplied by a fixed per-singer constant so
  the four wanders never sync) modulates that rate over time, and an
  always-on micro-jitter LFO (`throat.jitter`, fixed distinct Hz per singer)
  adds a small flicker under every note, not just held ones — the existing
  slow vibrato law (fades in only past `vibDelay`) is untouched. For "sounds
  more human": a continuous breathy **aspiration** noise (new `breath.
  aspiration` param) rides under each voice on the *same* line-envelope
  (`v.env`) as the tone, shaped near her own formants (`1800×formantScale`
  bandpass) — no new scheduling needed, it fades with the phrase for free.
  TIMBRE: 40→**48 params** (throat +3, breath +1, four singer groups +1
  each). `TIMBRE.touch` extended for all of the above; `buildVoice` now
  takes the shared noise buffer so aspiration doesn't need its own.
- **Pick-up ideas** (carried from the brief): a VESILNA wedding-ladkannia
  genre; a second tonic literal an octave down for a mixed-voice mode;
  humanized stagger of the pidkhoplennia entrance; a "far across the
  field" long-predelay room as a WHERE-style toggle; the sonority law is
  enforced by construction at structural moments (line-finals, druha's
  derivation) rather than swept at every scheduled instant — a deliberate,
  documented scope decision, not a gap.
### TESSERA — new machine, op. XVII (a self-predicting language model)
**Branch:** `claude/llm-machine-architecture-5ji49g` · **File:**
`tessera/index.html` · **Status:** done, verified headless (Chromium). New
op. Registered in `index.html` (card + counts), `README.md` (row + count),
`officina` (chip), `CLAUDE.md`/this file; counts bumped sixteen → seventeen
everywhere. **Renumbered XVI → XVII at landing:** SUBLOW landed as op. XVI
on `origin/main` while this was in flight, so per the claiming rule TESSERA
took the next numeral. `tessera/SPECULUM.md` (the design brief) deleted per
its own instruction — this thread is the fold-in.

A design-then-implement arc (GENESIS/HARMONIA precedent): answers the
maintainer's question — *what machine would an LLM like, translated into
something humans can experience?* The argued answer: the one aesthetic
channel a next-token predictor and a human ear genuinely share is
**expectation** — Meyer 1956 / Huron ITPRA / IDyOM's music-as-prediction is
the same loop as autoregressive sampling; tension IS surprisal. So the
machine *is* a language model, small enough to be exact and to hear.

- **The law is a real, exact language model** (`ENGINE-BEGIN…END`, pure,
  DOM-free, `window.__TESSERA`): a variable-order Markov model with
  **interpolated PPM-C blending** (`p_k = c/(n+t) + (t/(n+t))·p_{k-1}`,
  uniform base, no exclusion). Starts **empty**, learns **only from its own
  output**. Two coupled streams (pitch + duration), each its own model
  (duration order capped at `min(ORDO,2)`). Every token has p>0 always, so
  surprisal is finite. Sampling is tempered (`q ∝ p^(1/τ)`); **surprisal
  (−log₂ p) and entropy (−Σ p log₂ p) are taken from the UNTEMPERED p** — the
  model's true feeling regardless of how adventurous the sampling was told to
  be.
- **Exact forgetting** (`MEMORIA`): the sliding window keeps the last W
  tokens; `learn()` adds the K+1 observations a new token closes and, on
  overflow, removes exactly the K+1 the evicted front token anchored
  (context-start = the evicted position). **Verified bit-identical to a
  from-scratch rebuild on the last W tokens** at every W∈{32,128,512},
  K∈{1,2,4}. When a habit's support expires it is genuinely gone and its next
  occurrence re-surprises the model.
- **Every pressing is a completion:** the seed derives a forced 5-token
  prompt (uniform gamut pitches, durations from {2,4}), so the first event's
  surprisal is exactly log₂|A| — maximal, the first mark on a blank mind.
- **Zero ET:** pitches are JI degrees of a gamut (V/VII/XII, 5/7/12 tones,
  5-limit) over a single Hz literal, **196** (G); `f = 196·num/den·2^k`, k
  chosen by a deterministic nearest-in-log register fold (band 98–784). No
  `mtof`. ∅ (rest) is a real token that enters the context and is learned.
- **Controls ARE the phenomenology** (all law, none in TIMBRE): CALOR
  (temperature τ 0.4/0.8/1.3/2.2) · MEMORIA (32/128/512) · ORDO (1/2/4) ·
  GAMVT (the alphabet + entropy ceiling log₂|A|) · TEMPO. **Any law change
  regenerates the score** (path-dependent); if playing, the transport
  restarts from bar 0. TEMPO rides live (doesn't change tokens).
- **Voices:** VOX (2 detuned saws → per-note lowpass; surprise sets level,
  brightness, attack 45→4 ms, and vibrato — a confident note is soft/round,
  a surprised note cuts). NIMBVS — the halo: the top-4 untempered
  alternatives as sine tones, each gain ∝ its p, the cloud scaled by entropy;
  when the model is certain it falls silent. FVNDVS — a just drone (98 Hz +
  3/2). PVLSVS — a tactus tick whose level follows an EMA of entropy. Master:
  warmth shaper → glue comp → brick-wall limiter (−1.5 dB, ratio 20, the
  GONGAN/DIAMOND ceiling) → out trim; seeded IR (so the WAV is deterministic).
- **Scheduler machine** (RILLE-family `schedTick`, 40 ms, ~0.3 s lookahead,
  time-accumulator so live TEMPO changes apply forward). **Non-looping:** on
  reaching the cached end the generator *extends* (16-bar chunks, model state
  continuing) — the WAV cut is the first 64 bars (512 eighths) of an endless
  mind, deterministic. **NB the piece is ~3 min at default tempo, so the
  offline cut renders ~40 s** headless (same rate as RILLE's 120 s plate at
  ~60 s). Kept it fast by putting the reed formant on the vox BUS not
  per-note, skipping the vibrato LFO on calm notes, and capping the halo ring
  — do not re-add per-note formants.
- **Canvas — everything shown is a number the model actually computed:**
  left, the piece as a **mosaic**, one course per 2 bars, hue = gamut degree,
  lightness = surprise, ∅ = grout gap; the **MEMORIA window is visible** (in-
  window tiles lit, older tiles matte, a gold dashed line = the forgetting
  edge crawling behind the playhead); the page turns every 64 bars. Right, the
  live **posterior** as a labelled ratio ladder (chosen bar in teal) plus the
  entropy/surprise **sparklines** — the pressing's EEG. `prefers-reduced-
  motion` slows the redraw. Emblem: a mosaic of tesserae, one lit gold.
- **TIMBRE:** 27 params in 7 groups (master/room/vox/nimbus/fundus/pulsus +
  **sensus** = the surprise→sound mapping ranges — voicing, not law). Bridge
  verbatim; `TIMBRE.touch` ramps master/room/bus/formant live; `TIMBRE.demo`
  starts the transport (continuous-machine convention).
- **Verified headless** (`scratchpad/verify-tessera.mjs`, playwright-core +
  bundled Chromium, 46 checks): PPM distributions match hand-computed values
  and sum to 1; incremental counts + predictions equal from-scratch on last-W
  across all W/K; surprisal/entropy exact for every event; determinism (same
  hash ⇒ identical tokens; extend ⊃ direct-512); mean surprisal rises
  monotonically across the four CALOR stops; BREVIS forgets a learned bigram
  while LONGA keeps it; every freq = 196·num/den·2^k in-band with k=0 first;
  first-event surprisal = log₂|A| and ∅ never in the prompt; realtime runs,
  offline WAV cuts clean, hash round-trips, OFFICINA schema/set/bulk round-
  trip; zero pageerrors. Screenshot-checked (entropy sparkline visibly
  settles as the mind learns).
- **Pick-up ideas** (from the brief): CALOR annealing (τ on a slow seeded
  arc); a second voice whose context is the first's stream (a canon where the
  comes is an expectation of the dux); human-editable prompt tiles; a
  septimal gamut (7/4, 7/6) once the 5-limit voice is proven.

### SUBLOW — new machine, op. XVI (dubstep / sound system music)
**Branch:** `claude/dubstep-machine-scaffolding-jcz8a9` · **File:**
`sublow/index.html` (`sublow/NOTES.md`, the build brief, deleted per its own
instruction once implemented — RILLE/DIAMOND precedent — this thread is the
fold-in) · **Status:** done, verified headless (Chromium). New op. **Landed as
op. XVI, not XV** — DIAMOND landed first while this branch was still
unlanded, so it renumbered at rebase per the claiming rule below. Registered
in `index.html` (card), `README.md` (row), `officina` (chip), CLAUDE.md and
the file-structure list above; counts bumped fifteen → sixteen everywhere.

Two-session build: the scaffolding session did sound design, composition spec
and UI (per the now-deleted `sublow/NOTES.md`); this session implemented the
engine, audio graph, canvas dynamic pass and verify against that brief, then
rebased past DIAMOND's landing and registered it.

- **The idea.** Dubstep as born in Croydon (~2000) and deepened at DMZ/FWD>>
  (~2005). Three load-bearing laws: (1) **the sub-bass is the lead** — the tune
  lives in the low end, everything above is atmosphere/rhythm; (2) **halfstep**
  — 140 BPM but the snare cracks *only on beat 3* (`SNARE_STEPS=[8,24]`), so it
  moves at 70 while hats tick 140, the space is the point; (3) **the bass
  talks** — a resonant lowpass swept by a **tempo-locked LFO**, rate = rhythmic
  division × bpm/60 (verified exact: div 1/2/3/4 at 140 bpm → 2.333/4.667/7/
  9.333 Hz). The wobble is *rhythm*, not vibrato. Plus sound-system culture:
  the dubplate, bassbins as the instrument, the dub siren, and **PULL UP** —
  the rewind, spins back then lands the next scheduled bar on the drop
  (bar 17) without restarting the transport.
- **Name** SUBLOW — London pirate-radio's word for the bottom octaves; the
  machine speaks sound-system English (run it / pull up / cut a dub).
- **The engine (`genAll`, seeded, deterministic):** `makeBass` walks a 2-bar
  riddim from a weighted degree pool (root-biased), note 1 always root on the
  downbeat; `makeDrums` builds the halfstep kit (kick always includes step 0,
  extra kicks never land on the snare's [8,24]); `makePad` writes 8 breaths
  alternating i/♭VI, **third-less by construction** (root·fifth·octave·
  optional-ninth — verified: no chord tone sits a 3rd/4th above its own chord
  root, checked relative to the shifting root, not the tonic); `makeLead`
  (EAST only) writes a 4-bar call/response in the hijaz-flavoured mode, landing
  each response on root or fifth; `makeArrange` fixes the 64-bar form (INTRO/
  BUILD/DROP A ×2/BREAK/DROP B ×2/OUTRO). **DROP B reuses `bassB`** — same
  notes, talk bumped +1 (capped 3), ghost snares 1.5× hotter — "same tune,
  more chat," not a new composition.
  Deliberate deviation from the brief: **tempo is NOT folded into the RNG
  seed** (the brief's contracted signature keeps `bpm` as a parameter, but
  composition ignoring it is the better call) — dragging the tempo slider
  re-times the same riddim rather than rerolling it; the wobble LFO and
  scheduler both read `st.bpm` live, so a tempo change re-vibes the next bar
  with no regeneration and no restart. Mood/talk/seed edits DO regenerate and
  hand the new score to the running scheduler (`RT.g=st.g`), same convention.
- **The audio graph:** single-deck (no crossfader — this isn't a DJ mixer like
  RILLE), master pre→shaper→4:1 comp→out-trim→destination, `G.floor` hiss tap
  post-comp. Duck bus carries **only sub+pad** (kick env dips them; wob/kick/
  snare/hats/perc/lead/fx are unducked, per the brief). **Wobble has no
  separate mixer channel** — `vWob` sums into `G.part.sub` (through its own
  highpass at the 110 Hz crossover) because the user perceives "the bass"
  (sub+talk) as one fader; the mute strip only has 8 buttons (`PARTS`), not 9.
  Sub chain lowpassed at the crossover as a safety net (it's already ~sine).
  All 12 voices (`vSub vWob vKick vSnare vHat vShaker vPerc vPad vLead vSiren
  vRiser vSpinback`) read `TP` at schedule time. `saveWav`/`encodeWav` copied
  verbatim from RILLE (HANDOFF flags this as a repeat gotcha — two earlier
  machines shipped without it).
- **Canvas — the stack:** a wall of speaker cabinets (scoop subs / kick bins /
  horn tops) + LED strip + a riddim lane drawing the 2-bar bass phrase *as the
  wave it speaks* (period = wobble division, dive = tail dropping toward the
  x-axis). Dynamic pass while playing: sub-cone excursion keyed to the
  sounding note's own wobble phase, a horn flash ~200 ms after each beat-3
  snare, an LED VU that goes red-hot only in the drop sections, and a lane
  playhead. `prefers-reduced-motion` → playhead only, no cone/LED motion (the
  static wall + lane redraw is cached; the dynamic pass is a plain rAF loop
  gated on `st.playing`, no separate offscreen layer needed since it's cheap).
- **Verified headless** (Chromium, playwright-core, `--autoplay-policy=
  no-user-gesture-required`): engine invariants across 5 riddims × 4 talks ×
  30 seeds (deterministic, note-1 fixed, snare fixed, no kick-on-snare,
  fundamentals fold ≥ `SUB_FLOOR`, pads third-less, DROP B talk-bump, lead
  EAST-only, arrange length 64); wobble-rate math exact; realtime transport
  runs and PULL UP survives; every one of the 8 mixer parts audible solo
  (including EAST's lead and the FX bus's siren/riser — the first solo pass
  missed those because it only probed bars with no FX events, a test-coverage
  gap, not an engine bug); 64-bar offline cut NaN-free, peak ≈0.70 (no clip,
  real headroom under the 1.0 ceiling), head energy present after the
  loop-tail fold; OFFICINA schema (55 params / 11 groups) + live `set`/`bulk`
  + localStorage overlay + `?factory` bypass all round-trip; hash v1 restores
  mood/talk/bpm/mask/seed. **64-bar cut takes ~50 s wall-clock** in this
  sandboxed headless environment (≈110 s of audio) — consistent with RILLE's
  own noted precedent ("120 s plate cuts in ~60 s — fine"), not a regression.
  Zero non-environmental console/page errors (only the sandboxed Google-Fonts
  fetch, present on every machine).
- **Pick-up ideas:** a stereo-width treatment above the crossover (sub stays
  dry/mono/centre by law, but wob/pad/lead currently render mono too — could
  widen them without touching the low end); a second EAST-style lead mood; the
  `'stab'`/`'thin'` pad kinds (DUNGEON/STEPPA/WOBBLE) are simpler than the
  `'drone'` swell (short offbeat shells / fifth-only respectively) — could use
  their own OFFICINA-exposed envelope shaping if the maintainer wants more
  contrast between sessions on the bench.

### App icon + universal pause button + cohesion (this branch)
**Branch:** `claude/opuscula-icon-design-1uqyt7` · **Files:** `icon.svg`,
`icon-512/192.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, `favicon-32.png`, `site.webmanifest`
(new, repo root); every page `<head>` (icon links); all 14 machines that lacked
one (pause button); `index.html`/`README.md` (shared-keys note + the file
table/conventions here). **Status:** done, verified headless (Chromium, all 15
machines PASS, zero pageerrors). Deliberately a **cross-machine sweep** on its
own branch (per the sweep rule) — no per-machine feature work mixed in.

- **App icon** (`icon.svg`, master; PNGs rendered from it via
  `scratchpad/render-icon.mjs`, playwright-core + bundled Chromium, scratchpad
  not committed). The catalogue's one constant graphic device is the **3px
  DOUBLE rule** (`index.html .rule`, every colophon border); the icon bends it
  into a ring — reads at once as the **O** of OPVSCVLA, a **pressed record**,
  and a **bell rim**, on the dark parchment ground (`--ground #14120f`, ivory
  `--txt`), with the **red "stamp" arc** that already recurs in the SCALA / PEAL
  / RILLE emblems, and a centre spindle. No text; legible 512→16px (at 16px the
  double ring merges to one — accepted; the detail is for home-screen/PWA).
  Wired into all 17 pages with **relative** hrefs (`./` root, `../` machines —
  this is a project-pages site, NOT domain root; root-relative would break).
  `site.webmanifest` is one catalogue-level manifest (icon `src` relative to its
  own root URL, so it's correct from every page that links `../site.webmanifest`).
- **Pause button on every machine.** RILLE already had one; extended its exact
  pattern to the other 14. Each: a secondary button beside play, **labelled in
  the machine's own tongue** (MORA/PERGE Latin · SOS/AR AGHAIDH Irish ·
  PAUSE/REPRENDS French · PAUSE/WEITER German · Pause/Resume English), disabled
  until playing, highlighted (`.on`) while held; **`p`** key added to the shared
  claves (no collisions — `p` was free everywhere). The mechanism is
  `ctx.suspend()`/`resume()`: every transport and canvas here is keyed off
  `ctx.currentTime`, which freezes while suspended, so play position and visuals
  hold and resume exactly. **Two gotchas handled:** (1) the iOS unlock `kick()`
  auto-resumes any non-running context on gesture/visibility — guarded with the
  machine's paused-intent flag (`st.paused` / `live.paused` / `paused`) so it
  can't undo a deliberate pause (COCHLEA/BOLG also bail their `kick`/`updateHint`
  when paused, so the SUSPENSUM hint doesn't show during a pause). (2) **NENIA**
  is the exception — its playhead runs on `performance.now()`, not ctx time, and
  it auto-stops on a wall-clock `setTimeout`; pause freezes the playhead at
  `pausedAt`, resume slides `playStart` forward by the paused span and reschedules
  the stop timer for the time that remained.
- **Cohesion tweaks (small, as invited):** the shared-keys note now lists
  **p = pause/resume** everywhere it was enumerated — landing `index.html .notes`,
  `README.md` shared grammar, each machine's in-page keys line + colophon, and
  the Conventions bullet here. A `button:disabled`/`.pick:disabled`/etc. opacity
  rule was added where a machine had none, so the disabled pause reads inactive.
- **Verify:** `scratchpad/verify-pause.mjs` drives every machine play → pause →
  resume → stop headless, asserting the button is disabled before play, enabled
  after, shows the resume-word when paused and the pause-word when resumed,
  disabled again after stop, and **zero pageerrors** (font-CDN-under-proxy noise
  filtered, per precedent). All 15 PASS.
- **Pick-ups:** a maskable-icon variant (safe-zone padding) for Android adaptive
  icons if wanted; per-machine `apple-mobile-web-app-title` so an installed
  machine names itself; the icon's red arc is nearly invisible at 16px — a
  bolder favicon-only rendering is possible if the tab-strip mark matters.

### State of the branch farm — parallel-work snapshot (2026-07-17)
**Branch:** `claude/handoff-concurrent-changes-9uuwm8` (also added the
"Working in parallel" section above). Inventory of every `claude/*` branch on
origin at writing time; a session that lands, rescues, or deletes one of
these should update this entry.

- **op. XV double-claim resolved: DIAMOND landed first, keeps op. XV.**
  `claude/new-machine-concept-uap0bi` shipped `diamond/index.html` (Partch
  tonality diamond) and merged to `main` — see the DIAMOND thread below.
  `claude/dubstep-machine-scaffolding-jcz8a9` (SUBLOW — dubstep / sound
  system; `sublow/index.html` scaffolded + `sublow/NOTES.md`) was still
  unlanded as of DIAMOND's merge (confirmed against the live branch list) —
  per the claiming rule it **renumbers to op. XVI** at its next rebase.
  Directories don't collide, so no file conflict either way.
- **Stale but carrying unlanded work:** `claude/orientation-3k25et` has a
  KHÖÖMEI change never landed ("breathe — dynamic drone + real breath
  pauses", +50/−15 in `khoomei/index.html`), now ~57 commits behind — rescue
  by rebasing (expect conflicts with the TIMBRE hoist) or re-implement, or
  drop. `claude/project-handoff-guide-7l2awu` adds per-machine
  `docs/works/*.md` handoffs — an approach superseded by this file;
  recommend deleting.
- **Dead — no merge base (pre-rewrite history), cannot be merged:**
  `claude/404-page-load-error-3da6u0`, `claude/cleanup-and-docs-sizjmt`.
  Their surviving ideas (exit-to-landing link, PEAL acoustic switcher)
  already landed on main independently; recommend deleting both.
- **Merged into main, safe to delete:** `banjo-loop-sound-design-qjlfm4`,
  `minimal-deep-tech-guide-ta175d`, `new-machine-design-y66pvl`,
  `opuscula-general-leuzu2`, `project-working-conventions-hlurpe`,
  `project-working-conventions-xjaafw`, `rille-chord-dissonance-io1zr6`,
  `rille-hiss-pause-4dojix`, `rille-tonal-composition-n8zfie`,
  `voice-synthesis-settings-ifeuah` (all `claude/…`). Branch deletion is the
  maintainer's call — sessions shouldn't delete branches they don't own.
### DIAMOND — new machine, op. XV (Harry Partch's tonality diamond)
**Branch:** `claude/new-machine-concept-uap0bi` · **File:** `diamond/index.html` ·
**Status:** done, verified headless (Chromium). New op. Registered in
`index.html` (card + counts), `README.md` (row), `officina` (chip),
`CLAUDE.md`/this file; counts bumped fourteen → fifteen everywhere.
`diamond/GENESIS.md` (the design brief) deleted per its own instruction —
this thread is the fold-in.

A design-then-implement session: op. XV conceptualized with full creative
freedom (just intonation, otherwise open), written up as a self-contained
brief (`GENESIS.md`, RILLE/HARMONIA precedent), then implemented in the
same session against that brief. **Harry Partch's tonality diamond** —
chosen over raga, Kepler's *Harmonices Mundi*, barbershop, alphorn
(rejections argued in the deleted brief) because it adds the JI *system*
(American experimental line, absent from the catalogue) and **utonality**,
the subharmonic mirror no existing machine touches.

- **Zero ET anywhere** — the first machine with no `mtof` at all. Ratios
  stay integer `[num,den]` pairs end to end (`fold`/`diamondCell`); the only
  Hz literal is `392` (Partch's G, `f = 392 × num/den × 2^k`). Diamond
  matrix, unique-tone counts and root tables verified exactly against the
  brief's hand-derived tables (7/13/19/29 tones at limits 5/7/9/11).
- **The law is the circuit** (`genAll`): a seeded weighted Hamiltonian walk
  of the complete bipartite otonality/utonality graph — every one of the
  2n tonalities visited **exactly once**, strictly alternating (forced by
  the graph, not legislated), starting and ending on **O1** (the plain
  harmonic series). Each step is a weighted pick favouring small-ratio
  (consonant) root moves (`ratioWeight` — weight ∝ 1/(num·den) of the root
  interval). The closing edge — last utonality → cell(o,1) → O1 — always
  exists by construction.
  **Pivot audibility is tautological by construction**, not a runtime
  check bolted on after: `assemble()`'s Cloud-Chamber Bowl ring at
  station *i*'s final bar is `pivots[(i+1)%2n]`, and station *i+1*'s
  Harmonic Canon forces that same tone as its first note — both read the
  same `pivots[]` array, so they can't drift apart.
- **Six of Partch's instruments, synthesized** (`SYN_FN`): Marimba Eroica
  (root on every group-head, arch-cut bar model), Kithara (Karplus–Strong,
  warmed, gliss-strums the tonality at arrival), Harmonic Canon
  (Karplus–Strong double course, seeded stepwise ostinato that mutates one
  step per bar-repeat, density rising toward the station's end), Diamond
  Marimba (a 6(n)-stroke sweep at arrival + sparse off-beat strikes), Boo
  (bandpassed-noise patter alternating the tonality's two highest tones),
  Cloud-Chamber Bowls (detuned beating pair + inharmonic partials, long
  ring). Each voice folds into its own fixed Hz register band
  (`REGBAND`: eroica 49–98 · kithara 98–196 · canon 196–392 · marimba/
  bowls 392–784 · boo 784–1568). Additive meters (PULSE 5/7/9 = 2+3 /
  2+2+3 / 2+2+2+3), dry room send (`wet` default .08 — corporeal, not
  cathedral).
- **Controls:** LIMIT 5/7/9/11 · FLUX linger/walk/storm · LEAN
  utonal/even/otonal (station-bar table `STATION_BARS`; default UTONAL —
  RILLE's rationed-resolution taste made structural: the walk dwells in
  the dark utonalities and passes briskly through the bright) · PULSE
  5/7/9 · TEMPO 200–340 eighths/min. No mixer/mute row — the brief's
  explicit simplification, "the diamond is the interface." GONGAN-family
  skeleton: `genAll`→`assemble`→`renderMaster` (bake-per-(voice,ratio)
  kit, `mixHit`), realtime loop + identical offline WAV cut, loop-fold
  (`renderMaster(true)`) wraps the tail — including the final exit-pivot's
  bowl ring — back over the head, so **the WAV literally starts on the
  homecoming bloom**, no special-casing needed.
- **Canvas:** left, the diamond lattice rotated so the unity diagonal runs
  horizontal (`x=(i+j-(n-1))·DX, y=(j-i)·DY` — the classic Partch layout),
  active tonality's row/column lit and swept at arrival, pivot cell
  pulsing on the final bar, visited diagonals left faintly warm (cleared
  on a new lap). Right, the itinerary: one row per station (O/U glyph,
  root ratio, bridging pivot between rows), home ringed, current station
  boxed. Static layer cached offscreen, rebuilt on station change;
  `prefers-reduced-motion` disables the sweep/pulse animation.
- **TIMBRE:** 42 params in 8 groups (master/room/eroica/kithara/canon/
  marimba/boo/bowls — no separate mixer group, each voice's own `level`
  serves that role). Master out-trim/room-wet/limiter-ceiling ride live;
  instrument edits debounce a rebake (► HEAR convention, no mid-circuit
  restart). Bridge verbatim incl. `TIMBRE.demo` (per-voice auditions).
- **Master chain — de-fuzzed (maintainer: "too distorted").** The first
  cut leaned on a hard `tanh` shaper (`drive` .28) for loudness, which
  fuzzed the whole mix and squashed the dynamics flat. Reworked to
  **shaper (drive .06, warmth only) → glue comp (2.4:1) → brick-wall
  limiter (`limThresh` −1.5 dB, knee 0, ratio 20 — the GONGAN limiter
  precedent) → out trim**; reverb sums pre-limiter so nothing bypasses the
  ceiling. Measured on a fixed pressing: shaper deviation-from-linear
  **70.8 % → 15.1 %**, crest factor **1.99 → 3.66** (the struck bronze
  rings proud again instead of buzzing), output peak 0.76 (limiter holds,
  no clip). The metallic character is pure synthesis (inharmonic bars/
  bowls) and was never the shaper — only the fuzz was removed. `drive` is
  still exposed in officina for anyone who wants the grit back.
- **Verified headless** (playwright + bundled Chromium, run from session
  scratchpad, not committed — matches the GONGAN/TAMBOUR precedent of
  scratchpad tooling): diamond tables/unique-tone-counts/roots exact
  against hand-derived brief tables; journey law swept 4 limits × 3 flux ×
  3 lean × 12–25 seeds (900+ pressings) — alternation, every-tonality-
  once, O1-only-at-station-0, pivot membership, correct closure, station
  lengths all hold; frequencies land in-band and match `392×ratio` folded
  exactly; `renderMaster` deterministic, NaN-free, peak-normalised, loop-
  fold head energy present; every voice non-silent solo; realtime context
  runs; hash round-trips; offline WAV cut clean; OFFICINA schema/set/bulk
  round-trip; zero pageerrors (only the pre-existing Google-Fonts-under-
  proxy console noise every machine hits, per the TAMBOUR/GONGAN
  precedent). Screenshot-checked live render and `another()`/`TIMBRE.demo`
  exercised across all 8 groups with zero errors.
- **Pick-up ideas** (carried from the brief): the full 43-tone Monophony
  scale as a secondary mode; a *Barstow*-style speech-rhythm cantus on the
  Canon; a Quadrangularis Reversum canvas easter egg; per-side pulse
  flavors if the single meter reads flat. Kepler's *Harmonices Mundi* was
  the strongest rejected alternative — a candidate for a future op.

### RILLE — tonal recomposition IMPLEMENTED (from `rille/HARMONIA.md`, now deleted)
**⚠ REVERTED** — the maintainer judged this "worse than a day ago"; RILLE was
reverted to `e9846ec` (pre-recomposition) on `claude/rille-major-chords-a6pm9r`
(see the top RILLE thread). Both the recomposition (`c685fc6`) and the parallel
dub-techno-stabs follow-up (`a271100`) are kept in git, recoverable. The
write-ups here are the record of what was tried.
**Branch:** `claude/harmonia-handoff-tlncw8` · **File:** `rille/index.html` ·
**Status:** done, verified (Node structural sweep + headless Chromium smoke);
pushed. The self-contained brief `rille/HARMONIA.md` was the spec; it's deleted
now that the work is in — the reasoning survives here and in the commit message.

**Follow-up (maintainer ear-check: "still sounds doofy — the arpeggio, all
moods"):** the running broken-chord arpeggio was the culprit — a metronomic
index-walk cycling root-♭3-5-9 (up/dn/ud/rnd per mood) read as a cheesy
trance/eurodance arp, plus a low/muddy register and the TRÄNEN octave "reach"
plink. **Replaced the arpeggio with sparse dub-techno chord STABS:** the
hover chord is now struck as an open shell of the bar's shape (the shape minus
its top 9/4, so it stays dark/grounded; `quint` bars stab a bare fifth) on the
OFFBEAT 8ths only (EISEN also takes the on-beats for its industrial cluster),
one-ish to a bar with space around it, lifted into the stab register
(`foldSwellHz(barRootHz)×2`) via `vChord` — no melodic contour, no running
line, no octave pop. `g.arpSeq` is now `{s,vel}` stab positions (was
`{s,idx,oct,vel}`); the canvas step-mask still reads it unchanged. Deleted:
the `vArpN` pluck voice, the `arp` TIMBRE group (43→**40 params**), and the
dead `rate`/`dir`/`reach` mood fields (`arp:{}` now just `{dens}`). `vChord`
gained an optional `velMul`. Reader-notes + TIMBRE doc updated (stabs, not
arps). The tuning/harmony/cantus/cadence laws are untouched — only the hover
*voicing* changed. **Verified:** Node structural sweep 25/25 (item 8 rewritten:
stab events carry no melodic-walk fields, sit only on offbeats, counts stay
sparse — never a running arp) + a headless-free **runtime mock**
(`scratchpad/verify-rille-runtime.mjs`, minimal Web-Audio stub) drives the real
`buildGraph`/`makeDeck`/`scheduleBar` across all 7 moods × 3 Lösungen over 64
bars: no exceptions, zero NaN/Inf to any oscillator or param, 25k+ oscillators
live. **ENV NOTE for the next session:** Playwright's default `headless_shell`
Chromium is currently crashing the node process on `.launch()` in this sandbox
(silent, no output) — the full `chrome` binary at
`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome` launches fine, so pass
`executablePath` to it (the verify scripts already do); and the audio-graph
runtime is better checked with the Web-Audio-mock runner than a live render
anyway. Still worth a maintainer ear-check that the stabs read as dub-techno,
not the old arp.

Reworked RILLE's whole tonal path per the maintainer's mandate: **no major
moods or vibes** (major only ever to resolve minor progress), no goofy plinks,
simplified input, and **just intonation end to end**. What shipped:

- **Majors abolished from hover.** Kind `'maj'`, `MAJ_SHAPE`, the ascending
  glint, kind `'pre'`, `PROGS`, `harmRecipe(M,P)` and `voiceAt` are gone.
  Major-quality hover degrees (♭VI/♭VII/♭II) are now voiced **thirdless**
  (`quint` = 1/1·3/2·9/4) — 1–2 bars, passing colour, dark. The **only 5/4 in
  the machine** is the raised leading tone (`dom7` shape) on one cadence bar,
  which is 15/8 over the tonic — the just leading tone. Both are mechanized in
  the verify's "5/4 audit".
- **Cadence = lament tetrachord.** Last 8 bars of a `cad` span: bass walks
  1→♭7→♭6→5→1 (`desc`·16/9 ×2 → `desc`·8/5 ×2 → `dom7sus` → `dom7` → `bloom`
  ×2), the 4-3 suspension resolving across the two dom bars, the leading tone
  raised for exactly one bar. The 2 hover bars before each window are forced to
  degree 0 (the "8" the tetrachord descends from); the 8 bars before lean off
  the tonic (weights ×1.5). `half` deleted — non-landing moods get `loesung:0`
  (NIE, cad 0, no dominant ever).
- **Two-level JI lattice, no comma drift.** Every tonal freq is
  `f = tonicHz × DEG[deg] × SHAPE[k] × 2^n`, `tonicHz = mtof(g.root)` the ONLY
  `mtof` in the tonal path (verified: exactly one call site). `DEG` (degree
  roots over tonic), `SHAPES` (voice shapes over the bar root), `MODE_JI`
  (scale ratios for cantus passing tones) replace `JI[]`/`jf()`/`HOVER_SHAPE`.
  Roots re-anchor to the tonic each bar (fixed-lattice, not chained — COCHLEA
  owns comma drift). `vBass` now takes **Hz** (41 Hz floor preserved in Hz);
  bass pattern offsets became ratios (0→1/1, −12→1/2, −5→3/4, −2→8/9). Swell
  dyads: dom-sus [4/3,7/4], dom-raised [5/4,7/4], tonic [6/5,3/2], desc
  [3/2,9/4], pad hover [3/2]. AUTO-SET seam stays ET (Camelot labels stay true).
- **Dorian abolished.** DÄMMERUNG and SOG → äolisch (`mode` and `modeName`);
  SOG's warmth is the thirdless sus9 voicing, not the natural 6th. Roots/BPM
  untouched → Camelot table intact (FINSTERNIS 4A, SCHATTEN 1A, TRÄNEN 8A,
  EISEN 9A, DÄMMERUNG 7A, LEERE 5A, SOG 6A, asserted in verify).
- **Arp** resolves ratio shapes (`barRootHz × SHAPE[idx%len] × 2^oct`); the
  octave "reach" is TRÄNEN-only (`arp.reach:.15`, was a semitone `+12` on any
  mood at .30). `quint` bars roll root-fifth-ninth by construction.
- **Cantus (TRÄNEN).** Pentatonic random walk replaced by a seeded descending
  "sigh" cell (`[♭6,5,4]` weighted ×2) + fading echo over 8 bars; first/last
  notes chord-tone-locked to the bar (step the cell down the fixed order and
  retry; a bar that locks no cell falls silent). Melody band [4t, 4t·8/5], no
  octave pops. One sanctioned ti(15/8)→do figure, seeded p=.5 on the raised-dom
  cadence bar.
- **Input simplified.** The 8-chip PROGS block and the bassmode row are gone;
  one 3-chip **LÖSUNG** row (NIE/SELTEN/OFT = cad 0/64/32) replaces them, mood
  default pre-selected, override sticks until mood change. `follow` is a mood
  constant now (no UI). Ledger HARMONIK shows the pool in ♭-aware romans with a
  superscript 5 on thirdless degrees. Hash key `l` replaces `p`/`f`; legacy `p`
  maps tolerantly (0→default, 1–2→NIE, 3–4→SELTEN, 5–7→OFT), old `f` ignored,
  permalinks re-voice (precedented). No hash version bump.
- **Copy:** reader notes ("Longing and release", "Affect and law") rewritten
  for the lament-bass/thirdless/one-leading-tone story with the Dido/chaconne
  reference; all dorian mentions swept from `rille/index.html`.
- **Verified** (`scratchpad/verify-rille-tonal.mjs`, Node sweep + Chromium;
  quick Chromium runner `verify-rille-chromium-quick.mjs` alongside): 25/25
  Node checks (bar-kind law, 5/4 audit, cadence-window shape, forced-i bars,
  cad:0 emptiness, bass-root walk 16/9→8/5→3/2→1/1, JI purity over the closed
  ratio set, single `mtof`, cantus band + chord-tone lock + ≤3 notes/2 bars,
  no major-6th anywhere, arp directions/reach, quint-bar arp tones, Camelot
  table, legacy-`p` mapping). Chromium: all 7 moods × 3 Lösungen render
  NaN-free with audio; AUTO-SET blend runs both decks then settles; ledger
  HARMONIK + Lösung re-default + OFFICINA bench round-trip pass. Only console
  noise is the shared Google-Fonts CDN block (environmental, filtered).
- **Pick-ups / rejected (do not "improve" back in):** half-cadences, Picardy
  third (only if the maintainer asks by name), chained-root JI (COCHLEA's
  territory), pure-3/2 Camelot hops, keeping dorian. EISEN's 45/32 cluster is
  deliberately harsh — 7/5 is the softer option only if the maintainer flags
  it. Cadence phrase length (8 bars), the swell dyads and shapes live in
  `buildHarm`/`SHAPES`/`scheduleBar`; the sigh cells + lock in `genAll`.
- **Ears check (state for the maintainer):** render TRÄNEN·OFT and SOG·SELTEN
  — the writing hovers in pure minor, thirdless where colour passes, the one
  leading tone lands at 15/8, and it tunes beatlessly off one tonic. No bright
  plinks, no noodling. (Headless verify confirms the structure and clean
  runtime; the subjective listen is the maintainer's to make.)

### GONGAN — new machine, op. XIV (Central Javanese court gamelan)
**Branch:** `claude/new-machine-design-y66pvl` · **File:** `gongan/index.html` ·
**Status:** done, verified headless (Chromium). New op. Registered in
`index.html` (card), `README.md` (row), `officina` (chip), CLAUDE.md and the
file-structure list above; counts bumped thirteen → fourteen everywhere.

Cyclic-time engine on the FOLI/TAMBOUR skeleton (prerender → one master
buffer → realtime loop + offline WAV, identical graph). Design:

- **The law is the cycle.** A `FORMS` bentuk fixes the colotomy exactly
  (0-indexed beats): lancaran 16 (kethuk on the odd marks, kempul 6/10/14
  with wela at 2, kenong 4/8/12/16), ketawang 16 (kethuk 2/6/10/14, kempul
  12, kenong 8/16), ladrang 32 — canonical Solonese placement, enumerated in
  the verify script. Gong on the last beat; lancaran carries balungan
  *nibani* (tone every 2nd beat), the others *mlaku*.
- **Laras = this machine's own embat** (stated in the reader notes — no two
  gamelans agree, so a fixed house tuning IS the authentic move): sléndro
  steps 228/245/238/232/257¢, pélog 120/150/285/115/115/165/250¢, cents
  tables in `LARAS` (engine, NOT in TIMBRE — tuning is law, not voicing).
  Registers: demung base (sléndro 140 Hz / pélog 153, tumbuk nem aligned),
  saron ×2, peking ×4, bonang ×2/panerus ×4, kempul ×.5; gong suwukan =
  alt-tone/2, gong ageng = gong-tone/4.
- **Pathet** per laras (`PATHET`): sléndro nem/sanga/manyura, pélog
  lima/nem/barang (barang swaps tone 1 for 7; tone 4 never sounds — noted
  as sorogan territory). Each carries sèlèh weights + gong & alt tones.
- **The composer** (`genAll`): seeded sèlèh per kenong segment from the
  pathet weights, then a stepwise walk (gantungan hangs, rare leaps, bias
  toward the target growing as the segment closes) landing exactly on each
  sèlèh. **Gongan A ends on the alt tone (rung on gong suwukan), gongan B
  on the pathet gong tone (gong ageng)** — the piece only fully lands the
  second time round.
- **Garap is derived, never stored** (`assemble`): peking nacah (aabb; at
  higher irama abab·aabb), bonang barung pipilan (abab across the coming
  pair) dropping to octave **gembyang** on pairs that carry a kenong sèlèh,
  panerus at ×2 density, simplified kendhang-kalih token grids per form
  (`KENDHANG`, 2 slots/beat, b/u/t/k). **Irama I/II/III** doubles beat
  duration AND elaboration density (2/4/8 per beat, panerus ×2) — verified
  ratios exact. `bpm` (laya 60–132) is the irama-I walking pace.
- **The damping hand:** saron-family + bonang events get `cut` = time to
  the same instrument's next stroke +50 ms; `mixHit` fades the last 40 ms.
  Gembyang is ONE event (`oct:true`, dedicated `bonangO` dyad buffers) so
  zero-delta cuts can't occur.
- **Bronze synthesis:** bars = fundamental + free-bar partials (×2.76,
  ×5.40) in pairs detuned ±pairDet/2 (the shimmer), one model at three
  register decays (demung 1.5× / saron 1× / peking .65×); kettles add a
  half-frequency hum + strike bend; kenong beats slowly between paired
  modes (waver); **gong ageng = two modes `f0` and `f0+ombak` Hz beating at
  the ombak rate** under a slow bloom; kethuk deliberately dull. Loop fold
  carries the gong's long ring across the seam (tail = gong decay×2.4).
- **Canvas:** left, the gongan as a **wheel** (colotomic glyphs on the rim —
  G double-ring, N filled, P open, t tick — cipher numerals inside, sweeping
  arm, gold gong flash that persists across the seam); right, both gongan in
  **kepatihan** cipher with structural letters above and the gong tone
  circled, sounding beat underlined. Static layer cached offscreen, rebuilt
  only when the sounding gongan flips (`SHOWN_G`).
- **TIMBRE:** 43 params in 9 groups; touch = master/wet live, baked edits
  apply on the next play (no mid-cycle restart, per the ► HEAR convention),
  and `TIMBRE.demo(group)` auditions each voice freshly baked — the gong
  demo sizes its buffer to the ring (`decay*1.4+2 s`) so the ombak
  breathes. Bridge verbatim incl. the demo op.
- **Verified headless** (`scratchpad/verify-gongan.mjs`, playwright-core +
  bundled Chromium, 32 checks + a per-voice solo probe): colotomy tables
  canonical; 720 pressings (3 forms × 2 laras × 3 pathet × 40 seeds) —
  tones always in pathet, nibani rests honoured, kenong beats carry their
  sèlèh, A→suwukan/B→ageng; assemble + renderMaster deterministic; irama
  doubles duration and density exactly; render NaN-free, peak-normalised,
  head energy present after the fold; realtime ctx runs; hash round-trips
  on a fresh load; offline cut + WAV encode clean; OFFICINA set/bulk
  round-trip; every voice non-silent solo; zero pageerrors.
- **Pick-up ideas:** a *ngelik* section (high-register B gongan) instead of
  the current A/B variation; irama transitions while playing (the accel/
  rit between levels is the live tradition's drama — needs a scheduler
  rather than the prerender skeleton, or a rendered transition segment);
  gendér/gambang floating voices; a suwuk (composed ending) for the WAV
  instead of the ring-off.

### OFFICINA + TIMBRE rollout — done, verified, this branch
**Branch:** `claude/voice-synthesis-settings-ifeuah` · **Files:** all 13
machines, `officina/index.html`, landing colophon link, README section.
**Status:** done; every machine verified headless (defaults match the old
literals exactly, zero pageerrors, bridge round-trips, bench sweep passes).

Param counts: PAS SALÉ 48 · SCALA 15 · GRADUS 13 · RILLE 43 · COCHLEA 24 ·
BOLG 25 · PEAL 13 · HOLLER 25 · FOLI 43 · NENIA 12 · KHÖÖMEI 45 · SPANNUNG 40
· TAMBOUR 41. Mixer-style tables (FOLI/TAMBOUR `VOICES` gains, PAS SALÉ
`LEVEL`, COCHLEA/BOLG `NOMINAL`/`SENDS`) moved into TIMBRE (aliased where the
code reads them by the old names). GRADUS and NENIA are one-shot performers —
no touch hook, edits apply on the next play (stated in their TIMBRE docs).

Fixed along the way: **KHÖÖMEI and SPANNUNG called `saveWav()` without
defining it — their WAV cut was broken in production.** Added the shared
saveWav pill verbatim to both.

Noticed, pre-existing, NOT touched: **PAS SALÉ's full-song WAV cut renders
super-linearly in node count** (8 s of song ≈ 1 s render, half the song ≈
95 s; the full 116 s song takes many minutes headless). All ~3.5k events'
nodes are created up front in one OfflineAudioContext. If it matters, chunk
the schedule or render in segments. (RILLE's 120 s plate cuts in ~60 s —
fine.) Also: the offline render measured peaks ≈1.06 pre-encode there
(encodeWav clamps) — the -14 dB/3:1 comp lets transients through.

Pick-ups: an OFFICINA "export everything" (all machines, one JSON); a
hashchange listener in the bench (deep links work on load; switching machines
mid-session is chips-only); per-param A/B rather than whole-voice.

### TAMBOUR — playback fixes + battlefield graphic
**Branch:** `claude/project-working-conventions-hlurpe` · **File:**
`tambour/index.html` · **Status:** done, verified headless (Chromium); on `main`.

Two rounds of maintainer feedback after the op. XIII drop.

**Round 1 — sound.**
- *Clairon was Casio-ish:* rewrote `synClaironNote` from a static sine stack to
  a dynamic brass model — upper partials **bloom in over the attack** (a
  brightness envelope), a breath chiff on the onset, a ~1 kHz formant. That
  spectral motion is the brass cue. Also pulled it back (gain .50→.30).
- *Snares should cut through / "lots of drummers":* the snare is now a **section**
  — `SECT` trebles the caisse claire and doubles the roulante at mix time, each
  copy spread a few ms + across the pan field with a different kit variant and
  seeded jitter (`sRng`). Measured: claire is the loudest voice in the mix
  (peak 2.95 vs clairon 0.12).
- *Patterns just repeated one bar:* calls are now genuinely varying **4-bar**
  phrases (2/4→32 steps, 6/8→24). `'|'`/space bar separators stripped at parse;
  `steps`/`spb`/`beatsPerBar` **derived from the pattern length** at load (see
  the `for(k in CALLS)` block). Tablature draws per-beat + per-bar gridlines.

**Round 2 — the battlefield graphic (the fun one).**
- The `<canvas>` now has **two views**, a `viewMode` toggle (`♪`/`⚔` button on
  the plate): the drum **tablature** (`drawScoreView`, the old view) and a
  side-scrolling **battlefield** (`drawBattle`, a toggle; `viewMode` defaults to
  `'score'`).
- **The march drives a battle.** `buildPulse` bins one phrase's events into a
  PULSE (grosse+snare+cymbal coincidences = the big spikes, "the march hitting
  just right"). `frenchQuality` scores the march from state (cadence bell-curve
  peaked at **120**, ensemble fullness with the **snare worth half**, industrie,
  fantaisie) ≈ 0..1. `battleStep` integrates a **tide** ∈ [-1,1]:
  `push = fq * pulse * 3.4`, `foe = enemy.strength * 0.50`, `tide += (push-foe)*dt*0.5`.
  **Tuning is deliberate — a full on-cadence march wins vs all enemies, a plain
  march beats Spain/Austria but stalemates Russia, a snare-muted/off-cadence
  march is routed. Don't rescale one constant without re-running `scratchpad/sweep.mjs`.**
- **Armies:** `FRENCH` (left, bleu-blanc-rouge) vs `ENEMIES[st.enemy]` (right;
  dropdown `#enemy`, `ENEMY_ORDER` = prussia/britain/russia/austria/spain, each
  a coat/cuff/hat/plume + flag + strength). Figures (`makeArmy`): soldiers +
  a **drummer & bugler (music guys)** + a **flag bearer**, two rows. `modeFor(tide)`
  → advance / hold / **retreat = about-face** / **rout = scatter-and-run**
  (`fig.runX` integrates away from the front). Ground scrolls (`BATTLE.scroll`,
  a marching treadmill + advance bias); French drummer's sticks fall on the
  snare pulse. **Enemy music is a future addition** (their side pushes at a flat
  rate for now — the hook is `enemy.strength`).
- State: `st.enemy` in hash as `en`; `viewMode` is a view pref (not hashed).
- **Verify:** `scratchpad/verify.mjs` now also asserts France advances vs a weak
  enemy with a good march, the snare-mute quality drop, and the view toggle;
  `scratchpad/sweep.mjs` prints the tide outcome per enemy for good/mid/weak
  marches (the balance table). NB: the model-enum section leaves claire+grosse
  muted (mask round-trip) — the battle section resets mutes first.

### TAMBOUR — new machine, op. XIII (French military field drum)
**Branch:** `claude/project-working-conventions-hlurpe` · **File:**
`tambour/index.html` · **Status:** done, verified headless (Chromium). New op.
Registered in `index.html` (card), `README.md` (row), and the file-structure
list above; counts bumped twelve → thirteen everywhere.

An archetypal European war-march engine — snare-focused, martial-industrial,
French mother tongue. Built on the FOLI skeleton (prerendered kit → one master
buffer → realtime loop + offline WAV, identical graph). Design:

- **The law is the call.** Eight *batteries d'ordonnance* (`CALLS`, order in
  `CALL_ORDER`): la-marche, la-générale, la-charge, le-rappel, la-retraite,
  aux-champs, le-ban, la-breloque. Each fixes token patterns per voice over a
  step grid — **2/4 → 16 steps, spb 4** or **6/8 → 12 steps, spb 3**, always
  four walking beats to the phrase. `bpm` is the *cadence* (pas/min), the bass
  drum falls on the foot.
- **Rudiment token language** (`parseVoice`): `.` rest · `o` tap · `O` accent ·
  `f` flam (fla) · `d` drag (ra) · `r` roll unit. Runs of `r` collapse into one
  buzz roll resolving on the next stroke (`emitBuzz`, ~24 ms overlapping soft
  strokes, velocity swelling). Bass/cymbal use only `.`/`o`/`O`.
- **The machine composes the snare's ornaments** (`ornaments`, Fantaisie 0..3):
  drags ahead of accents, ghost taps in gaps, roll fills at phrase ends — a full
  flourish every 4th phrase. Seeded, so it round-trips in the hash.
- **Voices** (`VOICES`, = lane order + mixer): clairon · caisse claire (the
  star) · caisse roulante · grosse caisse · cymbales · enclume (anvil) · bourdon
  (steel drone). Snare = two membrane modes + a rattle of one-pole-highpassed
  noise for the wires; field drum = membrane, snares off; bass = deep membrane +
  beater click; cymbals = decaying metal noise + shimmer; anvil = inharmonic
  metal; **clairon = additive brass locked to partials of `FUND` (116.54 Hz,
  B♭) — a valveless bugle, notes are integer partials only**, synthesised
  per-note in `renderMaster` (durations vary).
- **Industrie 0..3 (`st.industrial`)** is the martial→industrial slide:
  `DRIVE_CURVE` (tanh waveshaper in `buildGraph`, harder each level) + the anvil
  doubling hard accents (`anvilCells`) + the bourdon. **Bourdon gotcha:** it's a
  continuous drone laid in *after* the loop-fold, its component freqs snapped to
  integer multiples of `1/oN` (`m=round(f*oN/SR)`) so it is **perfectly
  seamless** across the loop point — do not add it before the fold or it doubles.
- **Negative-time gotcha:** a flam/drag/ornament grace before the phrase-head
  downbeat rounds below 0; `push` clamps `t` to `≥0` (and `mixHit` guards
  `off<0`). Don't remove either.
- **Canvas is a tablature, not a wheel:** one lane per voice, rudiment glyphs
  (accent = tall capped bar, tap = short, flam/drag = grace ticks, roll = hatch
  band + bracket, bass = block, cymbal = burst, anvil = diamond, clairon = bar
  at partial height, bourdon = band), L/R foot markers under the axis, a red
  playhead. **Static score cached to an offscreen canvas (`oc`/`buildScore`);
  only the playhead + glow redraw** — cheaper than FOLI's per-frame ring.
- Mixer greys out (`.na`) clairon on calls with no bugle, and enclume/bourdon on
  Parade (industrial 0) where they're silent.
- **Verified headless** (`scratchpad/verify.mjs`, playwright-core + the bundled
  Chromium): all 8 calls parse to well-formed events (snare-dominant, rolls
  present, clairon partials in 2..8, no time past end), realtime context runs,
  offline cut renders, `renderMaster` is deterministic and non-silent (peak 0.9,
  RMS ~0.12). The only console error is the Google-Fonts CDN failing under the
  proxy — environmental, same link every machine uses, harmless serif/mono
  fallback.
- **Pick-up ideas:** the calls are idiomatic arrangements, not a claim to one
  authoritative score (stated in the reader notes) — a stricter transcription of
  a specific ordinance is possible. A "fifre" (fife) melodic voice over the
  drums, or a per-call default industrial level, are natural next steps.

### HOLLER — just-intonation fiddle, voice fixes, faster default
**Branch:** `claude/banjo-loop-sound-design-qjlfm4` · **File:**
`holler/index.html` · **Status:** done, verified headless (Chromium); pushed to
`main`.

Follow-up round to the loop/mellow/fiddle work below.

- **Temperament — the answer is "ET is right for the frets, wrong for the bow."**
  Fretted instruments (banjo, guitar, bass) stay equal-tempered — that's where
  frets sit. The **fretless fiddle** now plays **5-limit just intonation** against
  the key tonic (a folk fiddler leans on pure intervals by ear). New `JI[]` table
  + `jiFreq(midi,tonicMidi)` next to `midiToFreq`; the fiddle bus calls
  `jiFreq(e.midi, tune.tuning.tonic)`, everything else still `midiToFreq`. Verified
  exact: fifth 701.96¢, just M3 386.31¢ (ET 400), octave 1200. ♭7 kept at 16/9 to
  avoid beating the banjo's ET ♭7 — **pick-up:** a septimal 7/4 "blue seventh" is
  the more radical authentic option if a rougher fiddle is wanted.
- **Fiddle was a flute → now a fiddle.** Root cause: the additive tone rolled its
  harmonics off at ~3 kHz (hollow, few partials = flute). Fix: bright sawtooth to
  ~7 kHz (4th-order rolloff), audible bow-scratch on the attack, ±11¢ / 5.5 Hz
  vibrato — and, crucially, the fiddle now renders to its **own bus** shaped by
  violin **body-formants** (peaks 300 / 560 / **3000 Hz bridge-hill**, HP 180).
  The bridge-hill is what reads as "violin, not flute."
- **Guitar was a harpsichord → now a guitar.** Bare Karplus–Strong strums rang
  bright/metallic. Guitar+bass now render to their own **`bbuf`** warmed by a
  **lowpass 2500** + a **110 Hz body lift**; strum brightness dropped (gstrum
  .10→.06, tau .16→.14). Foot still writes straight to the main buffer.
- **Foot stomp was inaudible → a dull thud.** The old hit was a bare 62 Hz sine at
  ×0.5 — sub-audible on laptop/phone speakers. New `footHit`: a body swooping
  95→55 Hz (floorboard give) **plus a one-pole-lowpassed (~1 kHz) woody "knock"**
  so it carries on small speakers, at full level. Foot-only render RMS 0.03→0.10.
- **Default tempo 132 → 168 bpm** (state + slider); `another()` range widened to
  140–210 so a reroll is never slower than the default.
- All buses render NaN-free (peak clamps to the 0.9 normalise), realtime + offline
  WAV both clean, JI ratios exact. Tab canvas still banjo-only (per maintainer).

### RILLE — just intervals over the bass · bass rumble floor · master headroom
**Branch:** `claude/minimal-deep-tech-guide-ta175d` · **File:** `rille/index.html`
· **Status:** done, verified (Node JI math + Chromium peak measurement); pushed.

Maintainer: "turn the chords still in the mix into just intervals in relation to
the bass; some bass notes are too low and rumble; nothing may clip — we want
headroom." Asked which reading of "just intervals" — answer: **both** (strip to
intervals AND tune just). Three changes:

- **Just intonation against the bass.** New `JI[]` 5-limit lattice +
  `jf(bassMidi, note, dom)`: every harmonic tone (arps, glints, swells, cantus)
  is tuned as an exact ratio from the bar's bass root instead of 12-TET; the
  dominant's seventh takes the **harmonic 7/4**. `bRoot` (with the pedal/follow
  cadence logic) is hoisted OUT of the bass gate in `scheduleBar` — it is the
  lattice reference even when the bass is silent. Voices (`vChord`/`vArpN`/
  `vCantus`) now take **frequencies**, not MIDI; the scheduler owns tuning.
  Verified: every tone lands within 35 cents of its ET target (detune, never a
  re-voicing) and >60 Hz.
- **Swells stripped to bare intervals.** The cadence is no longer a 4-voice
  chord: V7sus = bass + **4/3 & 7/4**; V7 = **5/4 & 7/4** (the 5/4 over the V
  bass IS the key's leading tone); tonic = **6/5 & 3/2**. Pad-mood hover
  underlay is a single just **3/2** fifth. Register: lattice root folded to the
  MIDI 40–51 band, ratios ×2 → old stab register. Sus detection stays
  `H.notes[1]-H.notes[0]===5`.
- **Rumble floor (`vBass`):** fundamentals reached MIDI 24 (32.7 Hz) with the
  sub-osc at **16 Hz** — infrasonic. Now: fundamental floored to ≥ MIDI 28
  (41.2 Hz, lifted by octaves), the f/2 sub-oscillator only added when f≥82 Hz
  (sub ≥41 Hz; below that the fundamental IS the sub and plays alone, gain
  .8→.92 to compensate), plus a 25 Hz highpass in the bass chain.
- **Headroom (`buildGraph`):** new `G.out` trim (.76) after the master comp;
  `deckFloor` hiss reroutes through it (still post-comp, never pumped).
  Measured full-mix peaks per mood, 14 bars straddling a cadence, dust on:
  **0.78–0.89** (was 0.99–1.15 = clipping the WAV). Zero pageerrors.
- **Pick-up:** trim constant `.76` targets ≈ −1 dBFS worst case; JI ratios and
  the dyad choices live in `JI`/`jf` and the dom/tonic branch of `scheduleBar`.
  If the 45/32 tritone reads too sour on EISEN's cluster, 7/5 is the softer
  choice. WATCH: `startMix` blends two decks ≈ +3–4 dB summed — peaks stayed
  ≤.89 single-deck; blend transients may kiss ~1.0 — if audible, drop trim to .7.

### RILLE — arpeggios instead of chord stabs
**Branch:** `claude/minimal-deep-tech-guide-ta175d` · **File:** `rille/index.html`
· **Status:** done, verified (Node + Chromium); pushed. Maintainer's suggestion.

Hover chords are no longer stabbed — they're **broken open into arpeggios**: the
chord never sounds all at once, it's always reaching (and rolling arps are the
minimal/deep-tech texture anyway). Cadences deliberately stay sustained swells —
the **only** place a chord sounds whole, which is now part of the release.

- **`g.arpSeq`** (genAll, replaces `chordHits`): seeded 32-step/2-bar walk of
  chord-tone *indices* `{s,idx,oct,vel}`; notes resolve at schedule time against
  the narrative bar (`H.notes[idx%len]+oct`). Per-mood `arp:{rate:8|16, dens,
  dir:'up'|'dn'|'ud'|'rnd'}`: TRÄNEN rises in slow 8ths, FINSTERNIS/LEERE fall
  sparse, SOG rolls up in 16ths, SCHATTEN/DÄMMERUNG rock, EISEN's cluster becomes
  a dense random industrial sequence. Occasional +12 lift on the top tone ("the
  reach"); offbeat-8th accents; some downbeats skipped (space). Swing applies.
- **`vArpN`**: soft pluck, 2 detuned saws → warmth lowpass → `stabBP` → chordae
  part → **duck bus** (arp pumps with the kick). Notes overlap slightly
  (`stepDur*2.4`) for legato shimmer.
- **Passing majors** ('maj' bars): a quick 3-note ascending **glint** via vArpN —
  still one bar, still gone. Pre-dominant bars arpeggiate (tension rolls) before
  the V7sus swell. Pad moods (TRÄNEN/LEERE) keep a quiet swell UNDER the line.
- Canvas chordae ring now shows the arp step mask. `chordHits` fully removed.
  (Cantus rng draws shifted vs. the previous commit — pressings re-voice; harm
  timeline itself unchanged for a given seed.)
- **Verified:** Node — arpSeq deterministic, indices/octaves/velocities in range,
  8th-rate moods never emit 16th-offset steps, never empty; full narrative sweep
  still PASS (3360 pressings). Chromium — all 7 moods render arp+glint+cadence
  windows with zero pageerrors (densities: LEERE/FINSTERNIS 6 events/2 bars …
  EISEN 21). **Pick-up:** arp note length (`stepDur*2.4`), pluck level (.24) and
  the maj-glint shape live in `scheduleBar`/`vArpN`; direction/density per mood.

### RILLE — harmonic NARRATIVE engine (supersedes the progression rework below)
**Branch:** `claude/minimal-deep-tech-guide-ta175d` · **Files:** `rille/index.html`
(+ engine copy in `README.md`, `index.html`) · **Status:** done, verified (Node
structural sweep + headless Chromium); pushed.

Maintainer verdict on the previous pass: "still not landing — beats/rhythm good,
harmonic structures don't. Redo the composition structure; freedom." Diagnosis:
a fixed 2-bars-per-chord loop can never ache — even with a V7 in it, resolution
recurs mechanically, so nothing is *earned*. Replaced the chord loop with a
**64-bar harmonic narrative** (`HARMBARS`, = one WAV cut):

- **Two states.** HOVER: seeded weighted drift among the mood's minor chords
  (each 2–4 bars, deep **minor-9 voicings** per `HOVER_SHAPE[vstyle]`), majors
  (♭VI/♭VII/♭II/IV) capped **by engine law at 1 bar + one short stab** (`kind:
  'maj'`) — passing colour, never a destination. CADENCE: every `cad` bars the
  **last 8 bars of the span** run pre-dominant (`'pre'`, iv or ♭VI, 2 bars) →
  **V7sus held** → **V7** (raised leading tone; the 4-3 suspension resolves
  across the two swells) → **i blooming** (`'tonic'`, m(add9) swell) — unless
  `half:true`, which hangs on the V7 (half-cadence, never lands). Melody
  (`cantus`) falls silent on `dom` bars; bass follows chord roots through
  pre→dom→tonic so **iv→V→i walks in the low end** even in pedal moods.
- **Quality is chosen, not inherited**: `voiceAt(mode,root,deg,offs)` voices
  explicit semitone shapes (register-anchored as before); diatonic stacking and
  `buildChord` are gone, so no accidental clash is possible. Diminished pool
  slots are filtered at build (`poolDegs` keeps the labels truthful).
- **Recipes.** A progression is now `{pool:[[deg,weight]…], cad, half}` —
  `PROGS`: suum / schweben (i·iv ∞) / sehnen (+♭VI ∞) / halb (…V7 offen) /
  selten (one release per 64) / erzählen (per 32) / neapel (♭II colour) / oft
  (per 16). Moods carry `harm:{…}` (replaces progDeg/progDom/progHold):
  FINSTERNIS ♭II+half-cad (never lands), SCHATTEN cad 64, TRÄNEN cad 32
  (flagship), EISEN cluster-drone ∞, DÄMMERUNG cad 32, LEERE i·iv ∞, SOG cad 32.
  Ledger says **HARMONIK** with `harmLabel` (♭-aware romans + `…V7→i`/`(offen)`/
  `∞`); chips regenerate per mood. `g.harm[bar%64]` is the scheduler's only
  lookup; hash `p` = recipe index (0–7 as before).
- **Verified:** Node — 3360 pressings (7 moods × 8 recipes × 60 seeds):
  deterministic, majors 5.5% of bars and never >1 bar, every resolving recipe
  lands tonic-after-dom, half recipes never emit `tonic`, `cad:0` emits no
  cadence kinds, V7 always carries the leading tone, registers in range.
  Chromium — cadence windows render for TRÄNEN/FINSTERNIS/SOG/LEERE with zero
  pageerrors; recipe chips + ledger correct live; hash carries `p`.
- **Pick-up:** cadence phrase length (8 bars) and shapes live in `buildHarm`;
  swell dynamics in `scheduleBar`'s dom/tonic branch (`H.span*16*stepDur*.94`).
  Arrangement (`newArrange`) and the harm grid are deliberately uncoupled so
  live and offline stay identical — coupling cadences to BRUCH sections would
  be the next expressive step. Old permalinks: harmony differs (by design).

### RILLE — emotional-minor harmony: longing default, rationed resolution — SUPERSEDED by the narrative engine above; kept for the ♭9/register reasoning.
**Branch:** `claude/minimal-deep-tech-guide-ta175d` · **File:** `rille/index.html`
· **Status:** done, verified (Node harmony sweep + headless Chromium render); no PR.

Maintainer note: "the notes/harmonies aren't hitting right — vibe should be
emotional, minor, longing; major chords minimal and short; only resolving in
longer emotionally-charged sections." Researched emotional-minor writing and
reworked the harmonic language (not the synthesis). Four moves:

- **A real resolution — the harmonic-minor dominant.** Every mode here is minor,
  so its diatonic *v* has no leading tone and cannot pull home; the loop just
  floated. Added a `dom` chord style to `buildChord`: on the fifth degree it forces
  a **major third (the raised leading tone) + ♭7 → V7**, the one chord that
  genuinely resolves to i. It's reserved for cadences, marked per-progression.
- **`hold` = the charged, sustained cadence.** Progressions now carry a `dom` set
  and a `hold` set. `hold` chords are played as one slow 2-bar **swell** (pad-style)
  instead of short stabs, and the **bass steps V→i** (during `dom`/`hold` the bass
  follows the chord root even in pedal moods). So resolution only *lands* in the
  longer sections; elsewhere the minor hovers, majors stay short/passing.
- **Longing progressions.** New `PROGS` menu: harren (i), senken (i–♭VI), sehnen
  (i–iv), fallen (i–♭VII–♭VI–i aeolian descent), **andalu** (Andalusian cadence
  i–♭VII–♭VI–V), gebet (i–iv–♭VI–V), **aufloesung** (6-chord phrase, one V→i at the
  end). Mood defaults rewritten to match: FINSTERNIS i–♭VI, SCHATTEN i–♭VII–♭VI–i,
  **TRÄNEN i–♭VI–iv–♭VII–V→i** (flagship resolving), EISEN i (drone), DÄMMERUNG
  i–IV–♭VII–V→i, LEERE i (drone), SOG i–IV–V→i.
- **Modes toward longing.** SCHATTEN dorian→**aeolian**. Others kept (phrygian for
  the dark FINSTERNIS/EISEN, aeolian for TRÄNEN/LEERE, dorian for the warmer
  DÄMMERUNG/SOG). `progDom`/`progHold` are new optional mood fields; `g.dom`/`g.hold`
  ride alongside `g.progDeg`. `romanOf`/`chordLetters` take a `dom` arg and print the
  V/`x7`. New in-page "Longing and release" note explains it.
- **Verified:** Node — all 7 mood defaults + 8 progs × seeds (2240 pressings)
  compose with 0 non-cluster ♭9 and 0 structural fails; every `dom` chord confirmed
  a true V7 (leading tone + major third + ♭7), every resolving mood has a V→i tonic
  (e.g. TRÄNEN `…E7→Am`, DÄMMERUNG `…A7→Dm`, SOG `…D7→Gm`). Chromium — the four
  resolving/hovering moods render a full 16-bar phrase (cadence swell + bass V→i)
  with zero pageerrors; live UI ledger shows the prog correctly.
- **Pick-up / caveats:** `dom` assumes the marked step is **degree 4** (the V root);
  keep it there. On **dorian** moods, progs that use degree 5 (fallen/andalu/
  aufloesung) render a passing **vi° (diminished)** rather than ♭VI — valid, adds
  yearning, de-clashed, but if you want ♭VI there switch that mood to aeolian.
  **Permalink note:** this changes the harmony of *every* pressing (mood defaults
  and the `p` prog-index both moved), so links cut before this sound different — by
  design, no hash version bump. The register anchor puts V ~a fifth below the tonic
  stabs (same band, verified in range); lift it if a mood's V feels low.
### HOLLER — clean loop, mellower tone, a fiddle lead
**Branch:** `claude/banjo-loop-sound-design-qjlfm4` · **File:**
`holler/index.html` · **Status:** done, verified headless (Chromium); pushed to
`main`.

Three moves:

- **Seamless loop.** The master render is one pass (`dur`) + a `tail=1.1s`
  ring-off. Realtime looped the *whole* buffer, so every seam had a silent gap,
  and the canvas (which assumes a period of `dur`) drifted 1.1 s per pass. Added
  `makeLoopBuffer(buf,dur)`: cuts to exactly `round(dur*SR)` and **folds the
  ring-off tail back onto the head** (`out[i-L]+=buf[i]` for `i≥L`) so the last
  notes' decay carries over the loop point. `play()` now feeds that; the WAV
  `cut()` still uses the plain one-pass `R.buf` (unchanged, non-looping). Loop
  period is now precisely `dur`, which also re-syncs the playhead. Verified:
  `loopLen==round(dur*SR)`, non-zero head energy (folded ring present), no NaN.
- **Mellowed the timbre.** Softened the Karplus–Strong nail-click chip
  (`.13→.085`); in the body chain added a gentle **lowpass 5.2 kHz Q0.6** and
  eased the top **highshelf +2.5→+1.2 dB** (the `biquad` RBJ helper gained a
  `lowpass` type). Reads warm-on-a-porch rather than brittle. Peaking-330 pot
  resonance and highpass-85 untouched.
- **Added a fiddle part** — a fourth string-band voice (**bit 8** in `backMask`;
  old permalinks without the bit reproduce fiddle-off). It's a **bowed** string,
  so *not* Karplus–Strong: new `fiddleNote()` is additive — a 1/k sawtooth
  spectrum one-pole-rolled at ~3 kHz, bowed attack/release, faint bow-noise, and
  ~5 Hz / ±9 c vibrato. `fiddleEvents()` carries the tune's **melody an octave
  up** (`foldTo …,66,86`) in slurred quarter-notes (held `eighth*2*1.04` so they
  legato) with the odd passing eighth, swung with the lilt; folded into the same
  master buffer in `renderMaster` when `st.backing.fiddle`. New UI toggle
  `#bkFiddle` on its own row above the rhythm section (it's the lead, not the
  boom-chuck). **Default is ON** — the default hash is now `bk=11`
  (guitar+bass+fiddle). Reader "string band" note updated (heterophony);
  `another()` leaves backing as-is.
- **Pick-up:** the tab canvas stays banjo-only by design (it's tablature for the
  right hand — the fiddle isn't drawn, confirmed with the maintainer). If a
  busier fiddle is wanted, raise the passing-eighth probability (`rng()<0.32`) or
  drop it to the full eighth-note line for tight heterophony with the melodic hand.

### RILLE — minimal deep tech mood + smoother chords
**Branch:** `claude/minimal-deep-tech-guide-ta175d` · **Files:** `rille/index.html`
(+ mood-count copy in `README.md`, `index.html`) · **Status:** done, verified
(Node model check + headless Chromium render); no PR opened.

Driven by a minimal-deep-tech production guide. Two moves, both additive:

- **New 7th mood — SOG** (`id:'gurges'`, gloss *hypnotisch*): the warm, rolling,
  stripped-back deep-tech pocket the existing six lacked (they lean dark/
  industrial). 123 BPM, Dorian (bright natural 6th), `root:43` → **6A** on the
  Camelot wheel (was unused; keys are derived from `root`, no separate table).
  Rolling deep sub (`bass:'roll'`), soft multi-burst clap, offbeat opens, gentle
  `swing:.07`, moderate `duck:.42`, sparse **open-sus stabs** (`vstyle:'sus9'` —
  no third, deep-house colour; `progDeg:[0,3]` = i–IV). Appended to `MOODS`, so
  the affect button, key, arrangement and hash slot (`o.a`=6) all auto-wire and
  every existing permalink (indices 0–5) is untouched. All moods are minor-family
  → SOG stays on the A ring, participates in AUTO-SET harmonic mixing normally.
- **Smoother chord sound design** (`vChord`, all moods): the stabs bit because the
  detuned saws pushed buzzy upper harmonics through the resonant stab bandpass and
  an 8 ms attack clicked. Added a gentle **warmth lowpass** (pad 2200 / stab 2900
  Hz, Q .4) before `stabBP` and softened the stab attack **8 ms → 22 ms** (detune
  ±6→±5, peak .3→.28). **Timbre only — voicing/`buildChord` untouched**, so the
  earlier ♭9/register fixes still hold. EISEN's `[0,6,13]` cluster stays
  deliberately harsh; the warmth filter just rounds it slightly.
- **Verified:** Node — 7 moods, SOG=6A unique, 1600 SOG pressings compose with 0
  problems, non-cluster ♭9 count 0. Chromium — SOG selects at 123 BPM, full graph
  + `vChord` + `scheduleBar` + offline render run with zero pageerrors, valid
  audio, sus9 voicings correct (G–C–D–A / C–F–G–D). Only console noise is the
  Google-Fonts fetch the sandbox proxy blocks (cosmetic, pre-existing, all works).
- **Pick-up:** SOG uses short sus stabs, not a pad; if a pad-underlay version is
  wanted, flip `stab.pad`. The guide's "warm master saturation" was deliberately
  *not* added — the ask was less-harsh, so I subtracted highs rather than adding
  harmonics. `bpm 123`/`swing .07`/`duck .42` are the feel knobs.
### NENIA — simplified visuals + childlike control labels
**Branch:** `claude/project-working-conventions-xjaafw` · **File:**
`nenia/index.html` (canvas revert + control copy) · **Status:** done, verified
headless; no PR opened. Audio/compose untouched.

Two moves:

- **Rolled back the "whimsical" canvas layer** (the wobbly hand-drawn figures
  with faces/hair, the chalk-doodle backdrop, giggle sparkles, bouncy
  `sayWord` lettering, per-kid bob, and the title-dot bob) — it read as too
  busy. Restored the clean stick-figure style by resetting `nenia/index.html`
  to commit `1bf8558` (the "expand" state), which **keeps the new-game
  animations** (ball arc, hopscotch grid/hopper, arch bridge + filing line).
  `kidFig` is back to the simple `(x,y,c,scale,glow,fallen)` signature; active
  kids just glow. If revisiting whimsy, the busy version is commit `b7a3966`.
- **Reframed every control into child logic** (labels/option text only — all
  `value`s and `id`s unchanged, so the hash + engine are untouched). You pick a
  *person* to lead, not a pitch: "Who starts?" → **Marcus / Erica / Priya /
  Baby Theo** (still map to G/A/B♭/C via the unchanged `keysel` values; Erica =
  the old "A — the usual" default). Likewise "What are we playing?", "How many
  of us?", "How much of a tune?" (was Chant range: trichord/tetratonic/
  pentatonic → "Just the teasing notes / a bit more of a tune / the whole
  sing-song"), "Where are we?" (was Yard), "How fast?" (was Pace), and "ROWDY —
  nobody's quite in tune". The literary "on this music" notes keep the real
  theory terms — the child-framing is only on the interactive choices.
- Verified headless: parse clean, no console errors, clean-style arch/counting
  canvases render, option `value`s confirmed intact (engine unchanged).

### NENIA — expanded the playground-lore machine
**Branch:** `claude/project-working-conventions-xjaafw` · **File:**
`nenia/index.html` (+ catalogue lines in `README.md`, `index.html`) ·
**Status:** done, verified headless; no PR opened.

"More music, more options, more animations." Went from 5 games to 8 and widened
the melodic material.

- **Three new games** (indices 5–7 in `GAMES`/`compose`/`draw`): **BALL-BOUNCE**
  (two-ball; verse then accelerating count, a leg-over on every 4th beat, ends on
  a seeded miss), **HOPSCOTCH** (hop the numbered stones, both feet on the
  rest-squares 4/7/top, seeded wobble-out or a clean run home), **ARCH**
  (London Bridge / Oranges & Lemons — two kids form the bridge, the rest file
  through, it drops on the last word and catches whoever's under). RING was the
  `else` catch-all in `compose`; it's now an explicit `game===4` block and ARCH
  is the fallback.
- **Chant-range option** (`P.scale`, new `#scalesel`): trichord → tetratonic
  (adds `re`, −5) → pentatonic (adds low `do`, −7). `CELLS` gained `lv`-tagged
  cells; `fitCell(rng,n,scale)` filters to cells the range allows. The trichord
  taunt (`CELLS[0]`) stays pure regardless.
- **More options:** children up to 10 (was 8); a third yard, **Gymnasium**
  (`yard===2`), longer/brighter convolution — `makeVerb` and the wet-gain are
  now `[dry,corridor,gym]` lookups.
- **New animations** (in `draw`, early-return branches; new marks folded in
  `stateAt`): bouncing ball arc + leg-swing; a chalk hopscotch grid climbed by a
  hopper that tilts on a wobble; the arch bridge with a filing line that drops
  and rings the caught kid. New percussion voices: `bounce`, `legover`, `roll`,
  `hop`, `landboth`, `archdrop`.
- **Hash bumped v1→v2** (appends `scale`). `readHash` accepts both — v1
  permalinks load with `scale=0`. Verified: 72 game×range×kids combos compose
  with no bad degrees / zero-durations, all six degrees exercised, trichord
  gating holds, live play + hopscotch offline WAV render clean (peak .44), hash
  round-trips.
- **Pick-up:** the *range* option only affects the sung games, not the taunt (by
  design). ARCH could eliminate repeatedly like counting-out instead of a single
  capture, if a longer game is wanted.

### RILLE threads
All in `rille/index.html`.

### RILLE — harmonic auto-mixing between generated tracks (DJ set)
**Branch:** `claude/rille-hiss-pause-4dojix` · **Status:** done, verified
headless; no PR opened.

An **AUTO-SET** toggle turns RILLE from one track into an endless DJ set: every
`SET_BARS` (48) it beatmatches and blends into a fresh track in a
**Camelot-compatible key**, over a long phrase-aligned crossfade with a **bass
swap**. **JETZT →** triggers the next blend by hand (keys: `m` mix, `x` auto). A
readout shows current Camelot key + queued move.

- **Harmonic model (Camelot):** every mood is a minor mode → every track sits on
  the Camelot **A ring**; key = tonic pitch-class. `CAMELOT_PC`/`PC_CAMELOT` map
  both ways; ±1 Camelot = a fifth/fourth. Rendered moves (all minor→minor,
  wheel-legal): same key, +1, −1, +7 (semitone lift), +2 (whole-tone lift).
  `pickHarmonicMove` weights fifths/fourths highest. **B-ring / relative-major
  moves are NOT rendered — the engine has no major mode.** Mood keys: FINSTERNIS
  4A, SCHATTEN 1A, TRÄNEN 8A, EISEN 9A, DÄMMERUNG 7A, LEERE 5A. `genAll` gained a
  `rootOverride`; `st.root` carries the live key.
- **Minimal-techno principles:** long phrase-aligned blends (`BLEND_BARS`=16),
  beatmatch (both decks share one bar clock at `st.bpm`), bass swap (incoming
  low end held out by a highpass until the mid-blend swap so basslines never
  stack), transition-by-subtraction (outgoing stabs/claps/melody stripped at the
  swap, then it fades).
- **Dual-deck architecture:** `buildGraph` is now a shared **mixer** (master
  shaper→comp→out + shared reverb/delay sends). `makeDeck()` hangs a full
  channel-strip per track (part gains, own sidechain duck bus, stab filter, kick
  drive, sends, a **fader**/crossfader, a **bassKill** highpass, and a post-comp
  **deckFloor** for the hiss). Voice functions unchanged — first arg still `G`,
  now a deck with the same field names. `RT.decks[]` holds live decks (1
  normally, 2 during a blend); `schedTick` schedules each at the same `t`.
  `startMix`/`doSwap`/`finishMix` run the blend; outgoing deck retired, incoming
  promoted to primary (`st.g` etc.). Hash gained `k` (key) and `x` (auto).
  `cutPlate` builds one deck; offline WAV stays a single track.
- **Pick-up:** only the A ring is reachable — a major-mode voicing would unlock
  relative/diagonal (B-ring) moves and the full wheel. `SET_BARS`/`BLEND_BARS`
  are consts near the Camelot helpers for pacing tweaks.

### RILLE — hiss was pumped by the kick; added a pause button
**Branch:** `claude/rille-hiss-pause-4dojix` · **Status:** done, verified headless.

- **Hiss un-pumped + lowered:** the surface hiss (`h` noise loop in `startDust`,
  part `pulvis`/STAUB) ran through the master compressor, so the "constant" hiss
  ducked on every kick — nothing a real pressing does. Fix: added `G.floor`, a
  gain tapped **straight to `ac.destination`** after the master comp; hiss routes
  there instead of the part bus. Level `.006 → .004` (× mood `dust`). STAUB mute
  still rides `G.floor.gain`. Crackle/pops stay on the part bus (request was
  about the hiss).
- **Pause button:** `#pause` beside SPIEL (+ `p`). `togglePause()`
  suspends/resumes the AudioContext; everything is keyed off `ac.currentTime`
  (frozen while suspended) so transport + visuals hold and resume exactly.
  Button reads PAUSE↔WEITER. **Gotcha:** the iOS unlock `kick()` auto-resumes any
  non-running context on statechange/visibility — it was instantly undoing the
  pause. Guarded with `if(!st.paused)`.

### RILLE — chord progressions sounded broken/clunky
**Branch:** `claude/rille-chord-dissonance-io1zr6` · **Status:** done, committed,
pushed. No PR.

- **Root cause 1 — a diatonic ♭9 (the "broken" clang):** `buildChord()` stacked
  its ninth at `rel(8)` diatonic steps without checking the interval; on degrees
  whose upper neighbour is a semitone that ninth is a **♭9 (13 semitones)** — an
  avoid-note, baked into the default mood and most progressions. Fix: fold a ♭9
  to the octave (`nine()` → `13 ? 12`); guarded the `sus9` frame against
  aug-4th/dim-5th semitone clusters. `ferrum`'s `[0,6,13]` cluster is
  **intentionally harsh — left alone.** Commit `571907b`.
- **Root cause 2 — every stab in a different register (the "clunk"):** chords
  were voiced root-position at `root+12+base`, leaping up as the progression
  climbed. Fix: anchor each chord root to the octave nearest the key root, moving
  the voicing as a rigid block (intervals untouched). Span ≤10 semitones,
  worst step ≤9, nothing sinks into the bass. Precomputed in `genAll` as
  `g.chords`, read by `scheduleBar`. Commit `ea91fb2`. True nearest-previous
  voice-leading was considered and rejected — it drifted down and lurched ~14
  semitones at the loop point; register-anchoring is loop-stable.
- **Pick-up:** optional next step is light inversion / true voice-leading with
  anti-drift clamping, if parallel-block motion feels stiff. Engine is
  `buildChord` / `genAll` / `scheduleBar`.
